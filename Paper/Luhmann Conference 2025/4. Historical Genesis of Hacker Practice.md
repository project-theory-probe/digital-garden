# Open-Source Software as "rhizomatic trees"

* Open-source software is thus can be thought as "rhizomatic trees"
* Each software grows like a trees. Branching out and then pulled backed into the main trunk.
# Where did these come from?

* Richard Sennett (_The Craftsman_) and anthropologists like Tim Ingold have emphasized that **craft is inherently collaborative**: skills develop in workshops, practices are shared, and knowledge flows through doing. Craft traditions historically balance **individual mastery** with **collective standards**. But as Sennett warns, modern pressures (originality, branding) can fracture this balance, pushing masters toward adversarial individualism.
* Marcel Mauss (_The Gift_) showed that many societies are held together by **obligatory cycles of giving, receiving, and reciprocating** — gifts create bonds of trust and obligation. Later thinkers adapted this to modern contexts. Yet, the name "gift" is also a problematic concept because it presumes "posession." 
- Robert Merton described science as organized around “communalism” — knowledge as a gift to all.
- Hacker culture often invokes a generous sharing  (Raymond, Himanen, Coleman), where prestige comes from contributions freely given. 
* But — anthropologists (and STS scholars) caution: **gift logics are not universal**, nor timeless. They depend on context. Some says it is a rhetorical myth to say it is a universal human norms.
* There are several origin of he hacker ethos discussed:
	- Scientific ethos (Mertonian norms of openness, communalism, skepticism).
    - Countercultural ethos (Markoff, Turner): individual empowerment, anti-authoritarianism, communal living, systems thinking.
- “Openness” in hacker culture was not inevitable — as Thomas Haigh stresses, it flourished in niches (time-sharing labs, open networking projects), while other computing domains were proprietary. Hacker openness is **contingent**, not universal.
- The discussion of *where* it came from is not the point of this paper. Rather, the necessity would later be discussed by how these ethos reinforces communication as a system.
    

# Norms and Normativity

* Science and technology studies (STS) scholars (e.g. David Bloor, Harry Collins, Knorr-Cetina) critique “norms” like CUDOS as rhetorical resources: invoked to justify and legitimize science, but not necessarily adhered to consistently. From this view, norms explain less about practice, more about science’s self-image.
* Rouse’s _Articulating the World_ reframes the debate. Instead of seeing norms as fixed rules or mere rhetoric, he stresses normativity: practices are _accountable_. Participants act under expectations, and their actions can be challenged, defended, or revised. Normativity is not external; it’s _internal to practice itself_.
* This resonates strongly with Niklas Luhmann: communication is sustained by expectations (what counts as valid/invalid, work/not-work). Normativity structures autopoietic systems by making communication self-referentially coherent, even amid contingency.

# The code again

* This characters are homologically seen in the hacker norms and practices.
* The technology side, computer, works in digital. Any source-code either run or don't run. 
* The human side, hackers, work in millieu of their own. They have situated needs based on their environments. They choose to work on project, accept or reject updates based on pragmatic evaluation of whether it is useful or not.
* Thus these two needs, computer and hackers are fundamental to the rise of the code, "working/not working."
* Although the roots are two, the code works as singular. 
* (Ben diagram) Working is the overlapping area of "useful" and "running."
* This is since code is complex and complicated, those that doesn't run is not useful. Hackers don't create code from scratch. They hack them into their own use (that's why they are called hackers)
* Meanwhile, not all running source-code is useful. The projects and even language come and go, not because they are not runnable, but because they are deemed unefficient or somewhat less attractive (sinking ship) to the eyes of hackers.
* Thus, working/not working is the strong code that govern the communication of the open-source eco-system.

# Two threads of program

* It doesn’t reinforce each other.
* they together instead would reinforce the autopoiesis by ensuring the usefulness of self-referential communication. 
* Rhizomatic is supported under being compatible to existing systems.
* Arborescent is ensured of existence by having it proliferated and becoming a standard.
* Both are self-referential through the nature of computer where first and foremost the code should run. Network and reproducibility with zero cost is helping those self-referencing communications.
