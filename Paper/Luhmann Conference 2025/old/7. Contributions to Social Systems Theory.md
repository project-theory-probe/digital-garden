## **7. Contributions to Social Systems Theory**

The hacker system challenges conventional assumptions within social systems theory, particularly in relation to the role of institutions, the emergence of communicative codes, and the nature of systemic reproduction. It does so not through contradiction, but through expansion—offering a real-world instantiation of autopoiesis that operates without many of the stabilizing features traditionally associated with modern function systems. In this section, we reflect on three key contributions the hacker system offers to the ongoing development of Luhmannian systems theory: (1) the possibility of systemic autopoiesis without formal institutions, (2) the formation and reproduction of codes in the absence of explicit programming, and (3) the emergence of hybrid systemic identities sustained through structural coupling.

### **7.1 Autopoiesis Without Institutions**

In classical functional systems—law, economy, politics, science—institutions play a critical role in maintaining systemic continuity. Courts uphold legal communication, universities sustain scientific discourse, parliaments process political will. These institutional forms serve as memory-storing devices and organizational carriers of the system’s recursive operations.

Hacking, by contrast, reveals an autopoietic system that lacks—or resists—the equivalent of stable institutional infrastructure. Projects are often hosted on ephemeral platforms, contributors change pseudonymously, and long-term planning is regularly sacrificed to iterative decision-making. Yet the system persists. Communication continues. Code compiles.

This presents a challenge: how can a system maintain closure, boundary distinction, and recursive reproduction without anchoring itself in recognizable institutions?

The answer lies in distributed forms of institutionalization. Instead of fixed entities, the hacker system relies on protocolized environments: version control systems (e.g., Git), continuous integration pipelines, standardized licensing schemes, and communicative rituals (e.g., issue triage, release notes, forks). These are not institutions in the traditional sense, but they function as memory mechanisms and decision scaffolds. The system stores its past not in buildings or hierarchies, but in logs, tags, commits, and diffs.

Thus, Luhmann’s insight into the self-referential nature of social systems is extended: systemic reproduction need not be mediated by formal institutions. It can be materially embedded in codebases and communicative practices that are themselves recursively observed and altered. The hacker system is a living demonstration that institutions are not a prerequisite for autopoiesis—they are one possible materialization among others.

### **7.2 Code Formation in Weakly Programmed Systems**

Luhmann identified code as the binary distinction that enables system-specific communication: _legal/illegal_, _true/false_, _payment/non-payment_. Yet these codes are not arbitrary—they emerge through historical sedimentation and are stabilized by programming: the set of decision premises that guide their application.

Hacking reveals a system in which code formation occurs _without pre-existing programming_. The binary “working / not working” arises not from deliberation or legislation, but from recursive communicative feedback. Code is merged if it works; it is rejected if it breaks the build, causes regressions, or conflicts with project goals. There is no foundational debate over what constitutes “working”—the meaning of the code emerges _operationally_ through its repeated use.

This offers insight into how new functionally differentiated systems might emerge: not through declaration or institutional fiat, but through recursive closure around a self-validating distinction. “Working / not working” becomes meaningful not because it is universally accepted, but because it enables selective continuation within a communicative domain. Contributions that cannot be evaluated in this binary are excluded—not as an ideological judgment, but as a matter of operational incompatibility.

Moreover, unlike classical systems where programming is highly codified (e.g., laws, scientific method), the hacker system exhibits _weak programming_. It relies on norms (e.g., semantic versioning), conventions (e.g., “don’t break backward compatibility”), and collective memory. Decision premises are often tacit, learned through participation rather than training. Pull requests are reviewed, not against a fixed rulebook, but within a context-sensitive, evolving framework.

This situates the hacker system at an interesting boundary: it is neither fully programmed nor entirely spontaneous. It suggests that binary codes can stabilize even under conditions of weakly formalized programming—so long as the recursive mechanism of communication is preserved. This opens a new avenue for systems theory: the study of proto-systems or emergent systems whose codes are still sedimenting, but whose communicative boundary is already self-sustaining.

### **7.3 Hybrid Autopoiesis and Systemic Overlap**

A final contribution of the hacker system concerns its identity. Unlike traditional function systems, which operate with relatively clear societal mandates and distinct communicative goals, hacking occupies an _ambiguous systemic position_. It overlaps with science (through reproducibility and peer review), with economy (through platformization and monetization), with law (through licenses and IP), and with education (through documentation and mentorship). It borrows tools, norms, and expectations from each.

Yet hacking is not reducible to any of these systems. It maintains a distinct operational logic, defined by the “working / not working” binary and by the particular communicative forms that revolve around software construction, modification, and redistribution. It can neither be fully integrated into academic publication nor transformed into pure commodity nor wholly juridified.

This makes the hacker system an example of _hybrid autopoiesis_: a system that exists at the intersection of multiple social domains, yet maintains its own operational closure. It couples deeply, but selectively. It processes foreign codes (e.g., citation counts, salaries, patent claims) only insofar as they can be translated into its own recursive operation.

  

Such a system invites refinement of Luhmann’s concept of structural coupling. While Luhmann envisioned coupling between well-differentiated systems, the hacker case suggests the need to account for systems that arise in the _interstices_ of existing systems—anchored not in institutional distinctness but in communicative necessity.

Moreover, it expands the category of function systems. Hacking performs a _form-producing_ function in society: enabling infrastructural transformation, tool-making, and recursive world-building. Its communicative domain shapes how other systems operate. Git, for instance, reconfigured how scientific research is archived, how legal authorship is understood, and how capitalist firms manage codebases. These are not merely side-effects—they are consequences of hacking’s autopoiesis rippling into its environment.
### **7.4 Toward a Theory of Emerging Systems**

Taken together, these features call for a theory of _emerging function systems_. Such systems may lack full institutionalization, canonical programming, or stable social recognition, but they nonetheless reproduce a distinct communicative domain with recursive closure and code formation.

Systems theory must accommodate these emergent forms—not as anomalies, but as valid systemic entities with their own logic and evolution. Hacking is not an “informal subsystem” of science or economy; it is a communicative formation in its own right. Recognizing this requires expanding Luhmannian analysis to include systems whose boundaries are enacted through technical, rather than legal or normative, means.

The hacker system also prompts a rethinking of system/environment relations. Its operational closure is maintained not by isolating from external pressures, but by _absorbing and transforming_ them. It does not exclude law or money or truth—it recodes them. This suggests that resilience does not depend on rigidity, but on selective permeability.

In short, hacking contributes to social systems theory by demonstrating that:

- Autopoiesis can occur without institutions.
- Binary codes can emerge through recursive use, not foundational consensus.
- Programming can be weak but operationally effective.
- Systems can hybridize and still maintain closure.
- Emergent communicative formations deserve systemic recognition.
    
These insights push systems theory toward greater empirical sensitivity and conceptual flexibility—opening space for new kinds of social formations to be understood as autopoietic systems in their own right.
