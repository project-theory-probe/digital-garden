## **1. Introduction**

Over the past half-century, software has become deeply embedded in everyday life—coordinating infrastructures, mediating work, and reshaping the contours of social interaction. Yet within the field of social systems theory, particularly the work of Niklas Luhmann, comparatively little attention has been given to the modes of communication that emerge from software development itself. This paper begins from the observation that the practice of hacking—understood not as deviance or cybercrime, but as the iterative modification and reproduction of working software—has given rise to a distinct form of communication, one that cannot be fully explained through the codes of legality, economy, or science. Instead, it hinges on a materially testable distinction: working / not working.

Our aim in this paper is to explore how hacking, as a set of operations and decisions around source code, constitutes a recursive communication system. Drawing on Luhmann’s theory of autopoietic social systems, we argue that hacking constitutes an operationally closed mode of communication that reproduces itself based not on semantic consensus or institutional authority, but on executable artifacts—code that runs. This code-centric communication both challenges and extends Luhmann’s own account of functional differentiation, offering a perspective in which software practices do not merely couple with other systems but enact their own logic of reproduction.

The notion that communication can be materially instantiated—in source code, versioning infrastructure, and automated testing pipelines—calls into question assumptions about the symbolic generalization of meaning in social systems. In contrast to the legal system’s code of legal/illegal or the economic system’s code of payment/non-payment, the hacking community sustains itself through a code of working / not working, which is materially enforced and iteratively reinforced. When a program fails to compile, it cannot be ignored. When it runs, it becomes available for recursive modification. This binary distinction, though often framed in technical terms, acquires sociological significance: it becomes the basis upon which contributions are evaluated, decisions are made, and communities are organized.

This paper traces the emergence and consolidation of this communicative formation from the early days of university computing labs and hobbyist clubs to globally distributed practices such as the GNU Project, the Free Software Movement, and the infrastructure surrounding Linux kernel development. These cases illustrate how hacking has evolved not only as a practice but as a self-reproducing system of communication—one that has gradually developed its own forms of memory, normativity, and programmability. We show how licensing mechanisms like copyleft, infrastructures like Git, and cultures of “pull request” validation all serve to reproduce and reinforce the binary code of working / not working, while selectively responding to irritations from legal, economic, and political systems.

In making this argument, we propose three theoretical contributions. First, we extend Luhmann’s theory of codes and programmes to include systems in which the code is materially testable rather than symbolically generalized. Second, we examine how autopoietic closure can emerge from iterative, embodied practices rather than formal institutions—raising the question of how system boundaries can be enacted through infrastructures rather than declared through semantics. Third, we foreground the role of executable artifacts as communicative media, suggesting that social systems can reproduce themselves through interaction with shared, modifiable, and runnable code.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the relevant theoretical background, introducing the concepts of code, programme, and communication in Luhmann’s theory, while connecting them to emerging discussions in media theory and science and technology studies. Section 3 traces the emergence of hacking as a communicative system, focusing on the practices of recursive modification and execution. Section 4 analyzes the operational implications of the binary code working / not working, including its effects on collaboration, evaluation, and reproduction. Section 5 explores the programmatic structures that have evolved to sustain this code—such as licensing, infrastructure, and community norms. Section 6 situates the hacking system in relation to its structural couplings with law, economy, and science. Section 7 offers illustrative case vignettes, drawing from well-documented projects such as the Linux kernel and GitHub workflows. Section 8 discusses the broader implications for systems theory, and Section 9 concludes with reflections on future research.

Through this investigation, we aim not only to shed light on the unique form of communication enacted in software development, but also to demonstrate how systems theory can be extended to analyze new, materially grounded modes of meaning production in the digital age.
