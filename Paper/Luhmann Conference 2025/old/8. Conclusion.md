## **8. Conclusion**

This paper has proposed that hacking—particularly in its open-source, collaborative, and recursive instantiations—can be analyzed as a distinct social system in the Luhmannian sense. Drawing on empirical insights and theoretical scaffolding, we have argued that the hacker system exhibits autopoiesis through a recursive form of communication structured around the binary code _working / not working_. This code functions not merely as a technical evaluation but as the guiding logic that filters contributions, structures decisions, and enables systemic reproduction.

Several contributions emerge from this investigation. First, hacking demonstrates the viability of **autopoietic systems without formal institutions**. Unlike law, science, or politics, which depend heavily on stable organizational memory, the hacker system operates through distributed infrastructures—version control, documentation, forking—that enable self-reference without centralization. This challenges assumptions about the necessity of institutions for systemic closure and opens new pathways for understanding how systems can emerge and stabilize in fluid, decentralized contexts.

Second, we showed how **codes can form and reproduce through practice** rather than prescription. The code _working / not working_ is not formally legislated but sedimented through recursive interaction and conflict resolution. This highlights a form of _weak programming_—implicit, dynamic, and continuously adjusted—that nonetheless guides decision-making and boundary maintenance.

Third, the hacker system occupies an **ambiguous but resilient systemic position**. It overlaps with and is structurally coupled to law, economy, and science, yet retains its autonomy. Legal frameworks like copyright and licenses, economic mechanisms like funding or platform monetization, and scientific ideals like reproducibility all irritate the system. But these irritations do not dissolve it; rather, they shape its contours and push it toward further differentiation. This provides a valuable example of **hybrid autopoiesis**, where a system sustains itself by selectively internalizing and translating external influences without forfeiting its own code.

In theoretical terms, hacking urges us to expand systems theory in at least three directions: toward systems without institutional anchoring, toward communicative codes that arise outside classical domains, and toward boundary concepts that include emerging, digitally mediated systems. If autopoiesis can occur without formal institutions, and if codes can be materially embedded in protocols and infrastructures, then the landscape of societal differentiation is more complex—and more dynamic—than previously assumed.

Practically, this perspective equips us to better understand the dynamics of software development, digital infrastructure, and knowledge creation in contemporary society. It also offers strategic insight for actors navigating these systems—whether by contributing to open-source projects, regulating digital commons, or building tools that align with or subvert existing codes.

Future research could explore comparative cases—such as community science, blockchain governance, or DIY biology—to investigate whether similar system-like dynamics emerge. A deeper empirical study of decision premises and conflict resolution in hacker collectives could also clarify how weak programming functions in practice. Finally, the question of how emerging systems stabilize or dissolve—whether they become function systems or remain marginal—invites longitudinal study.

In sum, hacking is not merely a cultural or technical phenomenon. It is a communicative formation with systemic characteristics. Recognizing it as such not only deepens our understanding of hacking itself, but also expands the scope and relevance of social systems theory.
