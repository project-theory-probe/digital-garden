# Luhmann * New Materiality

* We have shown how new materiality is integrative to Luhmann's theory and vice versa.
* We demonstrated not only theoretically but also empirically.
* Luhmann explains what is social beyond human. New materialism shed lights on one of the "non-human" materials and show how they can be an active agent to form a communication.
# Material communication to operational closure

* Material communication has always been accumulative but specific and dispersive 
* It is when anyone from anywhere can join to discuss and contribute on the *same* object that we started to see closure in the communication
# The hacker culture reproduced

* It was the practices (represented in Git managements) that allowed this operational closure.
* There, the communication is closed but is always contingent by hackers as *parasites*.
* Adding to this ”arborescent" nature of the technology whats enabling the self-reference 
* 
* Also, the hacker ethos 
	* **Decentralization** increases environmental complexity (anyone can contribute, fork, or patch).
	- The hacker system _absorbs_ this complexity by filtering contributions (through uptake, critique, forking).
	- The redundancy and forking possibilities mean complexity isn’t destructive—it _reinforces_ the system’s capacity to keep reproducing communication chains.
	- In Luhmann’s terms: more irritations → more selections → more autopoiesis.
	* Decentralization means _no single point of control_. Any hacker can make a contribution (“anyone, anytime”), but the system only _keeps_ contributions if others respond (adopt, fork, patch, critique).
	* This filtering/uptake mechanism is what transforms raw utterances into **communication chains** that sustain the hacker system.
	* Decentralization allows for **redundancy** and **robustness**. Even if one node drops, others can reproduce communication. This ensures the continuity of the autopoiesis.
	* It also maximizes the pool of possible irritations → which strengthens the system’s ability to self-reproduce without relying on institutional carriers.
# Rhizomatic system against tech-giants

* Hacker culture is antithesis of economic system in a sense that it promotes conviviality.
* This can be a way of giving back our power in the surge of tech-giants and AI development.
