(Why call hacker culture a “social system” rather than a subculture/community?)

* Hacker culture has long been one of the mode of social-interaction, as long was the craftsman culture dating back to pre-history. 
* In the early days, hacker community was run by enthusiasts and academic researchers. Thus was unstable or dependent on other social system.
* However, open-source is now a thing that organizes and proliferate on its own. 
* We also would agree that it is either strongly coupled with by independent from economic, legal and science system.
* This paper we will investigate to see whether this could be seen as a social system differenciated from other systems, achieving "operational closure." This is a communication where the communication are conducted based on previous one. Communications are immanent in nature.
* This is very similar with how the communication of art was illustrated by Luhmann. The difference is that, hackers are in charge of both 1st and 2nd order observation.
* Also, the way the communication are done on top of one another is innately material (through and through) and accumulative.
* In this view, hackers are parasites. With the "open-ness" of the open-source, it metabolize the system further into evolution.

(What does it mean to call hacking a form of communication rather than merely a technical act?)

* For Luhmann communication belongs to system.
* Everything else is mere inter-action.
* To say hacking is a communication is near to saying that hacking belongs to a system.
* In fact, hacking is a great mix of freedom and restrictions. Many are virtual material and rules that enables effectiveness of the product and hackers freedom.
* The forms observed are shared not only by utterances but also by operations called “pull-requests” and “release”
* This “utterance” in return creates point of reference to “observe” the source code. (e.g. bug report, readme)
* But the communications are contingent. Firstly, software may not read what hackers write. Also, the code can proved to be incompatible to overall direction down the line. The owner may also reject the proposal according to the understanding of what the code does.
* This resistance is very site of mangle of practice. Moreover, for Luhmann this contingency is why communication are not done by actors alone. 
* Only communication communicates.
* As we would see in the later chapter, the communication is reproduced through mesh of material-discursive practices and recursive practice from second-order observations.


# Why materialistic than symbolic?

* The communication is two fold, material and linguistic. 
* They will discuss shared intention, roles and norms.
* But in the end what they communicate through is the source-code.
* Branch and pull-request gives special accordance of where the developers communicate from.
* The communication through source code is material, because although they are written in alphabets and numbers, they have a meaning to how it manifests materially.
* In fact, they are accepted from visual manifestations of it.

*  Thus, the prerequisite of the communication is that “it works.” In other words, it should be runnable in the first place.
* For Luhmann, any system revolves around the binary code.
* For hackers we propose that it’s “working/not working” 
* This is similar to Art’s code of “art/not art.” If it doesn’t run or work, then it is not regarded as worthy communication at all.

# Computer as media

* The computer can date back to Turing Machine.
* A Turing machine is a theoretical model of computation, conceived by Alan Turing, that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
* Alan Turing invented the "a-machine" (automatic machine) in 1936.
* A Turing machine can simulate a calculator. It can be programmed to do any finite set of arithmetic operations.
* But unlike a calculator, a Turing machine is universal: by changing its program (its transition rules), it can carry out any computation that is theoretically computable.
* In other words, computer had innate characteristics of "reproducability." It memorize and operates accurately as it was "programmed" to do.
* This strengthen the Stiegler's perspective on technology that views them as extended memory.
* It also enhanced people's collaboration by enabling shared materials.
* Together with hacker culture of building infrastructures and norms of code-sharing as recursive practice (Kelty), they formed self-referencing communication.

# Material-discursive

* Hacker culture and the success of Linux is often deemed as a product of luck and "fun."
* It is also often misunderstood as I explained above. 
* However, it is not a coincident that hacker culture are this free and collaborative.
* The hacker spirit can date back to medieval printing and craftsman workshop.
* And of course, we can go even further down to pre-history.
* This is because the hacking is about crafting, and crafting has been the innate activity for human in relation with material-human correspondense.
* Putting aside the fact that human cognition are inevitably entangled with material, our relationship with the materials are key to understand the underlining significance of the hacking achieving the "operational closure."
* Hackers not only interact, but *corresponds* with materials at hand. Which creates communication that are dynamic, interwoven and historical.
* This paper claims that this lineage of inter-action by craftsman has turned into autopoietic system by meeting with computer and the sets of operational practice.

	Ingold
	 * Ingold’s correspondence is based upon his previous work “lines.”
	* He talks about the processual, improvisational nature of the creation.
	* In hacking, hackers don’t apply forms onto the program. Rather he constantly writes and rewrites code until it works.
	* it is the interplay between hackers and computers as assemblage of technologies that crafts the software in correspondence.

	Pickering
	* In Pickering’s terms, hacking is pure “mangle of practice”: improvisation, resistance, alignment with machines. A parallel dances of material and human agency.
	* He argues that material agencies (machines, instruments, chemicals) have their own _temporal trajectories_ and _resistances_.    
	- Human actors (scientists, engineers) adjust, but so do the materials — leading to a “dance of agency.”
	- Crucially, he doesn’t treat technology as merely socially shaped; it _mangles back_.

	Suchman
	* Interaction is situated action: Human–machine interaction can’t be understood as the execution of predefined plans. It unfolds in real-time, contingent on the material, social, and institutional context.    
	- Reconfiguration of boundaries: The boundary between human and machine is not fixed; it’s enacted and renegotiated through practice. Machines are never “just tools” — they are actors in socio-material arrangements.
	- Design as political and cultural practice: Technologies carry the social orders and assumptions of their designers. Making machines that work well with humans requires attending to these embedded politics.

	Rouse
	* In Rouse’s sense, hackers are a site of world-articulation, where norms and practices crystallize into a durable way of being-with-technology.

* It is difficult to claim that it is “more” material.
* But it can be said that the code is material in the sense that it allows computer to manifest what it does, in a precise accuracy.
* This is very materialistic. Economic communication of paying/not paying happens mostly without using the product. Art has communication on art pieces but most are discussed through style of it, meaning it is more or less mediated by symbolic representations.

# The materialistic side of the code

* The materiality of the communication through this media reinforces a distinction.
* The distinction of what counts as communication. For software, it is whether it is runnable or not.
* That is the necessary condition for any commits, release, pull-request to be accepted.
* Especially as the system (software) gets complicated and complex, accepting something that isn't runnable and fixing it is as difficult as creating a new module from scratch.
* Thus, hackers communicates what is running. That is why they are called hackers instead of builders.
# Linux vs. Windows

* Before Git, Linux development relied on patches and centralized versioning (BitKeeper for a while). This created bottlenecks:
	- **Single points of failure**: A few trusted maintainers had to integrate all changes.
	- **Fragility of coordination**: With thousands of contributors worldwide, ensuring consistency and traceability of changes was a nightmare.
	- **Scaling issue**: Linux had grown beyond what email patch sets and ad hoc tracking could handle.
- This was similar with tension exemplified by Sennett: the workshop model strained when “masters” had to guard integration. It risked pushing Linux toward adversarial hierarchy.
- Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 after losing access to BitKeeper. Git’s design directly encoded the hacker ethos:
	- **Immutable history**: Every commit is cryptographically hashed, ensuring tamper-proof accountability of contributions.
    - **Distributed cloning**: Anyone can copy the _entire_ repository, including full history, into their own environment. This meant contributors didn’t depend on a central authority to “give permission” to experiment.
    - **Branching and merging**: Git normalized experimentation — every developer could fork, test, and merge changes fluidly.
- In practice, Git was not just a tool but a **philosophy of collaboration**: it materialized openness and reproducibility into the infrastructure itself.
- As a result it beat Microsoft's dominance.
	- In the 1990s, Microsoft owned the desktop OS market (~95% share).
	- Linux couldn’t compete with a single, polished, centralized product — it had to grow by **harnessing massive, distributed collaboration**.
	- Git solved the scalability problem: by lowering coordination costs, it enabled _thousands_ of developers (volunteers and corporate alike) to contribute without chaos.
- Linux went on to build its own legacy.
	- Git embedded **institutional memory**: every line of code had provenance, accountability, and traceability.
	- This made Linux trustworthy for enterprise adoption (IBM, Google, etc.), who needed guarantees of stability and governance.
	- By reinforcing the “anyone can clone, anyone can contribute” logic, Git ensured that Linux development was resilient against capture. Even if a corporation tried to dominate, the community could fork and continue.
- Linux's success wasn't accidental. It is a result of embracing the materialistic characteristic of the medium (computer) and reinforcing the material communication (git, history, branching)
# The question

* Another core of Open-Source was "free" and "fun"
* Where did the they come from?
