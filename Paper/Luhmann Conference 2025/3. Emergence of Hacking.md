##  3. The Emergence of Hacking: Practice Before Programme

  

**Purpose:** Trace how hacking emerged as an operational logic.

**Content:**

- Historical context: early labs (MIT, UNIX), hobbyist communities.
    
- “Hacking” as recursive engagement, not identity or ethos.
    
- Emergence of working / not working distinction as communicative filter.
    
- Note: Don’t romanticize hackers; show recursive stabilization via shared material operations.
