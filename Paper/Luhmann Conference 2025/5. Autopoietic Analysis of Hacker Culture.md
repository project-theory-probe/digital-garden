# What makes Autopoiesis?

* An _autopoietic_ system is self-producing, self-referential, and self-maintaining through its own operations and elements. In social systems, these elements are communications.
* Coined by Maturana & Varela to describe living cells, where enzymes produce both other enzymes and the cell’s membrane, sustaining the network.
* For Luhmann, communications produce both new communications and the boundary between communication and non-communication (system vs. environment).
- Operational closure – The system’s operations refer only to other operations within the system; meaning arises from internal connections (recursion), not direct input from the environment.
- Self-production & self-reference – The system creates its own elements and structures from within, without depending on external control or human subjects.
- Environment as irritation – External events don’t directly determine the system; they enter only as “irritations” or “perturbations” that the system reinterprets using its own structures.
- Openness through structure – Despite being operationally closed, the system is structurally open, allowing it to incorporate environmental triggers on its own terms.
- Simultaneous openness/closure – Closure preserves autonomy, while openness ensures responsiveness, without collapsing into external control.
- Complexity reduction – The system manages complexity by selectively connecting its elements and drawing its own boundary against the environment.
- Self-positing distinction – The key act of autopoiesis is the system making the distinction between itself and its environment from within its own operations.
- Dynamic identity maintenance – The system sustains its distinctness by continuously reproducing its own components and boundaries.

# Observation (1st, 2nd)

* Forms are the distinctions made by observation. 
* The interplay in the world of software are between hackers and computer.
* They mark distinction through inter-action.
* Also, hackers has their own way of perception through their communication.
* Communication also supports their perception. Sellars.
* For example, "refactoring" "tree-shaking" 
* Also, "branch" "commit" "move to" gives spacial recognition of where they are at.
# Media/form

* The materiality of the computer has a big impact of how hackers communicate.
* As we've seen before, computer is in essense, a calculator. 
* It requires certain input and rules we abide by.
* But in return, it accurately calculate and reproduce what has been commanded.
* It also records what has been inputted.
* This allows communication to be self-referencial. 
* The peculiarity lies on its material complexity that it manifests.
* Unlike words, this is not subjective to human interpretation. This source-code is the interpretation done by machine. Like punch-cards.
* As you can see, this media is supporting both programs of "cloning" "sharing" while imposing the restriction (running/not running) on the communication.
# Irritation

* As seen in previous chapters, the hackers ethos came from intertwinement of technology and human, which gave rise to both rhizomatic and arborescent programs.
* Even in medieval workshop, the craftsman couldn't escape from economic irritation. (e.g. Stradivarius)
* This is why, hacker's history came with an antagonistic relationship with economic and legal system.
* Economic system presupposes ownership and rewards the owner. Legal system, deeply coupled with those economic system, also protects those rights.
* Meanwhile, the hackers ethos are for freedom of sharing and owning. The concept of property rights and confidentiality prevented hackers ethos.
* Berkley tape was the repulsion of this. Linux also recreated UNIX like system for this matter.
* This led to the Stallman's act and success of open-source (Steven Weber).

# Structural Coupling

* Hackers themselves are not independent from the economic system. Many of them are rewarded for their skills. One of the motivation of joining open-source project is to prove their skills.
* Also, after structuating the copyleft license, it relied on the law to protect against the infringement.
* Also, artists and researchers uses and benefits from open-source codes. R or python module is deemed legitimate tools for conducting statistic analysis.

# Self-description

* During the irritation, many spokes person of the hacker culture and open-source has been describing about themselves.
* Hackers also constantly redefined themselves. Hacker conference are also for identities.
* They constantly described their concerns and updated their practice, which is now part of the program that reinforces the code "working/not working."
* This is called "recursive public" by Kelty.

# Evolution

* 
# Function (possibly)

* Luhmann doesn't talk what functions are assigned to each subsystem.
* Thus we can only associate meanings as second-order observer.
* That said, given that the culture came from inherent relationship between human and technology, we can call it as millieu of self-actualizaiton.
* Unlike economic system and organizations that works in it, there is no apparent divide between producer and consumer. 
* Digital technology can be manipulative and self-alienating, because it causes addiction and dependency.
* What matters to hackers, instead, is conviviality.
