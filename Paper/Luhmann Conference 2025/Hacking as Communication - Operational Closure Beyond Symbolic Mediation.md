[[1. Introduction]]

- **Research Question:**
    
    Where did hacker culture come from, and why can we call it a social system (autopoietic)?
    
- **Main Thesis:**
    
    Hacker communication emerged from a deeply material form of human–material correspondence—akin to the collaborative logic of Renaissance workshops—that computers transformed into a self-referential social system. This transformation bifurcated along two dimensions (human/design vs. material/technical code), producing rhizomatic, assemblage-like collaboration and arborescent, stratified technical structuration. These modes not only coexist but reinforce each other to survive, as explained by Luhmann’s theory of social systems. The nature and root of this system explain its irritability by, and structural coupling with, law, economy, and science—while maintaining operational independence.
    
- **Structure Preview:**
    
    Conceptual framing → Present-day communicative logic → Historical roots → Autopoietic analysis.

### **2. Hacking as Communication**

[[2. Hacking as Communication]]

- **Beyond Technology:**
    - Distinguishing hacking as a communicative practice, not just a technical act.
    - Operational focus on the “working / not working” distinction.
    
- **Correspondence Logic:**
    - Ingold’s two lines: image (human/design) and material (technical code).
    - Correspondence as the space where these lines meet in practice.
    
- **Two Communication Modes:**
    - _Rhizomatic (Assemblage):_ emergent, networked, flexible collaboration.
    - _Arborescent (Stratified):_ hierarchical, codified, rule-bound structuration.
    
- **Self-Reference & Recursivity:**
    - Reproducibility of computers enabling high-level communicative recursion.
    - How this recursion sustains system-level coherence.

### **3. Hacker's Ethic**

[[3. Hacker's Ethic]]

## **Hacker’s Ethic**

- Beyond material-discursive practices.
- Himanen: 7 principles of hacker ethics.
- Stallman: free software as a _social movement_ (Luhmannian sense).
- Roots visible in Homebrew Computing Club.
- Ethos not unique to computing; Kelly/Kennedy trace it back to Medieval/Renaissance creativity.
## **Medieval Hackers**

- Renaissance as flourishing of creativity.
- Printing press spread knowledge, nudged originality.
- Kennedy: “Medieval hackers.”
- Collaborative creator spirit as precursor to hacker ethos.
    
## **Workshops & Collaboration**

- Hacking as modern craft: _correspondence_ (Ingold).
- Human evolution = externalization into tools/symbols (Gourhan).
- Tomasello: collaboration is evolutionary grounding → shared intentionality.
- Sennett: medieval workshops fostered tacit knowledge, shared norms.
- Software parallels workshops: specs/issues (intentions) meet compilers/networks (materials). Verdict = _working/not working_.
    
## **The Code**

- Shared what was useful, proliferated masters’ work.
- Hackers solve their own problems → projects attract resonance.
- Rhizomatic, convivial (Illich).
## **Rhizomatic vs. Arborescent**

- Two coexisting norms:
    - Arborescent: accumulation (e.g. git management).
    - Rhizomatic: free sharing, ownership/control.
- Their tension shapes the trajectory of technology.

### **4. Historical Genesis of Hacker Practice**

[[4. Historical Genesis of Hacker Practice]]

- **Renaissance Workshops as Pre-digital Roots:**    
    - Material–conceptual interplay in craft production.
    - Shared codes, tacit knowledge, and social apprenticeship.
- **Transitional Phase via Computing:**
    - Early hacker culture in universities and research labs.
    - Implicit enactment of distinctions and norms in daily practice.
- **From Craft to Digital Autopoiesis:**
    - Transformation of correspondence logic through software reproducibility.
    - Expansion from localized workshop cultures to distributed, code-mediated communities.

### **5. Autopoietic Analysis of Hacker Culture**

[[5. Autopoietic Analysis of Hacker Culture]]
- **Luhmannian Framing:**
    - Code/program distinction as co-emergent in hacker practice.
    - “Working / not working” as systemic code.
- **Structural Coupling:**
    - Irritations from law, economy, and science.
    - Examples: licensing conflicts, commercialization pressures, scientific validation.
- **Operational Closure & Independence:**
    - Maintaining autonomy despite external demands.
    - Internal reproduction and boundary maintenance mechanisms.
- **Mode Interplay:**
    - How rhizomatic creativity feeds into arborescent codification, and vice versa.
    - This interplay as a source of long-term stability.

### **6. Conclusion**

[[6. Conclusion]]

- Recap: Origins → Transformation → Systemic autonomy.
- Implications: Hacker culture as a distinct social system, not merely a subculture.
- Future Directions: Comparative insights for other emerging technocultures.
