### **4. Mediation and Reproducibility: Source Code as Executable Medium**

  

**Purpose:** The conceptual core—how this medium enables communication.

**Content:**

- “Executable source code” as medium (in Luhmann’s sense): not just transmitting meaning, but enabling selection.
    
- Reproducibility not just for testing, but for referential convergence.
    
- Carpentry metaphor: proposals materialized, evaluated by execution.
    
- Compare to symbolic generalizations (law, economy, science)—show how this differs.
