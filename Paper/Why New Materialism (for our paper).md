* Why did I need to re-read past research in new-materialistic perspective and connect to Luhmann, in order to explain that hacking is autopoietic system? 
* It seems like a roundabout way without clear necessity.
* In order to say "new materialism" is necessary,
	1. I need to say that hacking is evidently material, and that past account of hacker practices fail to grasp this aspect. 
	2. The agency and entanglement of the matter is crucial to build Luhmannian account of "hacking as communication." In other words, past account fall short on this point.
	
* # **Answering #1 Hacking is evidently material, and past accounts fail to grasp this aspect:**
	- Levy (Hackers, 1984) and Himanen (The Hacker Ethic, 2001) both lean culturalist: ethics of openness, freedom, fun are treated as drivers. These are important, but they foreground ideals, not the material practice of code, compilers, infrastructure.
	- Coleman (Coding Freedom, 2012) is more cautious. She knows ethnography tends to emphasize “culture.” She highlights the diversity of hacker practices but doesn’t dissect how the material medium (codebases, version control, machines) enforces what counts as valid practice.
	- Kelty (Two Bits, 2008) comes closest: he says information itself “seeks out” people to do things that sediment into norms. But still, his emphasis is on recursive publics (reflexivity), not on the entanglement of machine resistance and communication structures.
- Past accounts acknowledge practices, but don’t capture the way material-discursive entanglement itself is constitutive of hacker communication.
- Coleman and Kelty were already edging toward practice-based accounts, but they didn’t push into the material-discursive ontology that we need for a Luhmannian argument.

- **Kelty on Hacker Culture, Norms, and Materiality**
	1. Free Software as Response, not Ideology
	2. Suspicion of Purely Ideological Readings
	3. Norms situates in practices of reuse, modification, and distribution of code
		- She highlights the material practice of source code sharing as the most distinctive component of Free Software: code is simultaneously expressive and performative.
		- This sharing produces its own normative order (who can participate, how changes are accepted, etc.). Norms arise in practice, not prior to it.
	4. Materiality over Ideology
		- She consistently stresses material over ideological explanations
		- Source code and infrastructure (mailing lists, versioning tools) are not neutral—they structure collaboration.
	5. Recursive Publics
		- Free Software communities are publics that reflect on and reshape their own conditions of existence.
		- They don’t just talk about openness—they build infrastructures (licenses, version control, governance models) that embody and reproduce it.
		- This recursive quality blurs the line between materiality (code, tools) and normativity (ethics, governance).
- New Materialism (Barad, Pickering, Suchman):
    - She stops short of analyzing practice as communication with material resistance.
    - Material is not just enabling; it has agency. Compilers reject bad code; Git forks preserve divergence; test suites enforce system boundaries.
    - Ethics doesn’t just come from recursive discourse (Kelty’s publics), but from agential cuts enacted by apparatuses (Barad).

* **Gabriella Coleman’s View on Hacker Ethics**
	1. On continuity and transformation of ethics
		- Coleman stresses that it’s a mistake to treat the “hacker ethic” as a fixed set of principles.
		- Early hackers (as Levy described) did not write manifestos; ethics were more tacit and taken for granted.
		- By the time of Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, explicit manifestos (like the GNU Manifesto) emerged, making ethics into a visible, contested topic.
	2. On diversity and sectarianism
		- Hackers are highly diverse and contentious about the meaning of “hack,” “hacker,” and “hacking.”
		- Yet, academics and journalists (including Levy) often flatten this diversity, presenting a singular “hacker ethic.”
		- Coleman highlights that this simplification masks important differences within hacker communities.
	3. On culture and ethics
		* For Coleman, hacker ethics are not timeless ideals but historically and politically situated.
		* They are shaped by both cultural narratives (e.g., Levy’s heroic framing) and by political projects (e.g., Stallman’s free software movement).
		* Ethics, in her account, is entangled with representation, reflexivity, and the cultural politics of hacking, rather than being derived directly from practice with machines or code.
* Filling a gap with Luhmann:
	* Coleman doesn’t show how self-description ties back into the systemic reproduction of communication.
	* Coleman is suggesting is second-order observation or self-description. Along with Kelty's discursive practice, we can also echo this part and show limitation upon introducing Luhmann.

- # **Answering #2 The agency and entanglement of matter is crucial to building a Luhmannian account of “hacking as communication.”:**
	- Luhmann alone cannot explain "hacking as communication"
	- Source-code is medium. 
	- Information of the communication is the difference of the source-code. 
	- But here there are two different kind of parser: human and computer. 
		- Human is autopoietic so it irritate and make structural couplings. 
		- On the other hand, computer irritates but won't make structural coupling in a strict sense (because it is not autopoietic). But it is certainly self-reproducing. 
		- However, it certainly is comprehending information and selecting them, forming double contingency. 
	- Computer is what Luhmann used to have framed as part of "environment."
	- However, we need to regard computer as parasite (Serres) or quasi-agent from New Materialist account.
	- The agency and entanglement of the matter is crucial for a Luhmannian account of hacking. Past accounts fall short because they miss that hacker communication isn’t only about norms or values—it is recursively stabilized by a non-autopoietic but selectively active environment (the computer).
