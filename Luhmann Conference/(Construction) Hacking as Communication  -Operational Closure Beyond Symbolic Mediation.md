Here is the skeleton structure of the paper. Let's write the details based off of [[(Abstract) Hacking as Communication  Operational Closure Beyond Symbolic Mediation]].


### **1. Introduction: Hacking as Communication, Not Theme**
  
**Purpose:** Position the problem and your intervention.

**Content:**

- Opening: Ubiquity of software; lack of social theoretical attention to its _operational_ dynamics.
    
- The core question: Can hacking be understood not just as a cultural practice, but as a distinct form of communication?
    
- Brief roadmap of the argument (not the paper).

### **2. Background: Systems Theory and the Question of Mediation**

  

**Purpose:** Clarify your theoretical foundation and what you’re building on or departing from.

**Content:**

- Recap of Niklas Luhmann’s theory of autopoietic communication systems.
    
    - Code and programme distinction.
        
    - Role of media in enabling communication (optional: cite _Theory of Society_, _Social Systems_).
        
    
- Why “functionally differentiated” is not the lens here.
    
- Positioning: You focus not on institutional stabilization, but on _operational closure and medium-specific reproduction_.

### **3. The Emergence of Hacking: Practice Before Programme**

  

**Purpose:** Trace how hacking emerged as an operational logic.

**Content:**

- Historical context: early labs (MIT, UNIX), hobbyist communities.
    
- “Hacking” as recursive engagement, not identity or ethos.
    
- Emergence of working / not working distinction as communicative filter.
    
- Note: Don’t romanticize hackers; show recursive stabilization via shared material operations.

### **4. Mediation and Reproducibility: Source Code as Executable Medium**

  

**Purpose:** The conceptual core—how this medium enables communication.

**Content:**

- “Executable source code” as medium (in Luhmann’s sense): not just transmitting meaning, but enabling selection.
    
- Reproducibility not just for testing, but for referential convergence.
    
- Carpentry metaphor: proposals materialized, evaluated by execution.
    
- Compare to symbolic generalizations (law, economy, science)—show how this differs.

### **5. The Reproduction of Hacking Communication**

  

**Purpose:** Show how the system began to self-reproduce.

**Content:**

- How internal decisions became stabilized: version control, forkability, licensing models.
    
- Role of Free Software Movement, Copyleft, Open Source (without reifying them).
    
- Linux as empirical culmination—not origin or exemplar, but proof of sustained closure.
    
- Material-discursive institutions arise to sustain the code of working / not working.

### **6. Irritations and Couplings: Legal, Economic, Scientific Interfaces**

  

**Purpose:** Situate your system without reducing it.

**Content:**

- Examples of structural coupling (e.g. GPL license, corporate adoption).
    
- How other systems irritate and are selectively integrated.
    
- But always filtered by “does it work?” not “is it legal?” or “is it paid?” or “is it true?”

### **7. Contributions to Systems Theory**

  

**Purpose:** Theoretical contribution, grounded in your findings.

**Content:**

- Operational closure can emerge outside institutional settings.
    
- Material media (executable code) can function as communication enablers, beyond symbols.
    
- Code can be implicit yet functionally stabilizing.
    
- Software development as case of semantic opacity, material transparency.

### **8. Conclusion: The Stakes of Operational Autonomy**

  

**Purpose:** Reframe the significance of your analysis.

**Content:**

- What does this mean for studying other communication systems?
    
- Implications for media theory, legal/political regulation, AI, or education?
    
- Limitations and further research (e.g., does AI change the working/not working code?)
