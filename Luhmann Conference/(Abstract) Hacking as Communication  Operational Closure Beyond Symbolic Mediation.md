While software now ubiquitously programmes everyday life, literature in social theory has paid relatively little attention to hacking—a set of communicative operations in which software programming is developed and reproduced via a binary distinction: working / not working. 

This paper examines the emergence of hacking as a form of communication that gave rise to a materially enacted mode of recursive reproduction. Drawing on Niklas Luhmann’s theory of autopoietic social systems, it argues that this mode of communication emerged within early software development practices—particularly through operations such as sharing, modifying, and executing source code. These operations were not coordinated by symbolic generalizations such as legality, profitability, or truth, but by the materially testable distinction of working / not working.

To understand the emergence of this communication, we examine the activities around software from the university laboratories in the early 1960s to the globalized landscape of contemporary personal technology. Hacking was the term adopted by computer hobbyists—those captivated by early computers and UNIX systems—to describe their collaborative, iterative engagements. These communities centered their communication (and fascination) on whether the software functioned—work or not work—regardless of legality, profitability, or ownership. When irritations were observed, legal language and moral ethos were introduced and gradually solidified to ensure the continued reproduction of the binary code working / not working. Responses included the Free Software Movement, the adoption of “copyleft” licensing (in contrast to copyright), and the strategic rebranding of “free software” as “open-source”. We also observe the recursive, reproductive, and system-level scalability of decision-making procedures—such as distributed version control, flexible software licensing, and frequent release cycles—that enabled the system to reproduce its operations based on internally generated criteria. These practices culminated in projects such as the Linux kernel, demonstrating the capacity of this communication system to rival proprietary software in both functionality and coherence.

This argument does not locate system genesis in specific individuals or causal events. Rather, it shows how contingent configurations of practice and irritation produced conditions under which communications became increasingly self-referential—selected and continued based on prior operations. Communication is mediated by source code that is executable, enabling a distinction that is not merely symbolic but materially enforced: it either works or it does not. Reproducibility here is not just a condition for testing but a basis for shared reference: contributors encounter, modify, and evaluate the same material instantiations, allowing collaboration to proceed through enacted proposals rather than semantic consensus. It proposes that software development communicates in a way that no longer depends on the legal code (legal/illegal), economic code (payment/non-payment), or scientific code (true/false) for its communicative reproduction, even as it remains structurally coupled to all three.

The paper contributes to systems theory by extending the discussion of code and programme beyond established systems. First, it demonstrates how a code—though implicit—can become socially effective through the contingent evolution of programmes that actualize and reinforce its operations. Second, it shows how recursive closure can emerge outside institutional settings, through materially anchored practices that gradually gain autonomy and closure. Third, it foregrounds how materially reproducible artefacts—such as source code—can function as communicative media, enabling selectivity and recursion not through symbolic generalization but through executable instantiation. Rather than tracing a single origin, the analysis focuses on how software development reproduces its own boundaries, organizes its own communications, and selectively integrates irritations from other systems.
