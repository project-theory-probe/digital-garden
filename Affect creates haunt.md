Environmental awareness 
	→ timelessness
		→ vitality affect

From Daniel Stern:
* ***Vitality affects** are felt qualities of **aliveness-in-motion**.
	- A sudden shift
	- A smooth flow
* bridges body and mind, emotion and movement 
* no duality
* communication before language

Then I read Zami by Audre Lorde about:
* experience of racism that is universally felt
	but no one can speak of
	or name

As the silence is felt, and there is no language to call that secret that which is felt pervasively but cannot be verbalized, the secret becomes a haunt, persistent and wordless, so we only have ourselves to point to (and blame).

> Since the only place I couldn’t see clearly was behind my own eyes, obviously the trouble was with me. I had no words for racism. (93)

Vitality affects, or affects, make haunting possible.
