Whitehead says there are 2 kinds of perception:
1. causal efficacy
	* before reflection or recognition
	* affective
2. presentational immediacy
	* sense-data

but intimacy is both

seeing something intimately:
3 criteria:
1. see a person's differences / uniqueness (seperational or differential patterns)
2. see oneness (beyond separation)
3. see "taboo" (no dichotomy)
