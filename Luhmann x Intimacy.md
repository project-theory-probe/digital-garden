Connection: [[INTIMACY]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[involution]]


"Every generalized symbolic medium is differentiated according to a specific threshold problem."


symbolic medium: love

threshold problem: 
* personal, emotional disclosure; 
* cannot be transferable or impersonal;
* itâ€™s about being **seen and chosen** as a singular person;
-> sorting personal, emotional communication

communication system: intimacy - where people exchange personal disclosures under trust

code:
- _intimate / not intimate_
- _being loved / not being loved_

code must be duplicated:
* i love you --> i love you, too
* must reciprocate
