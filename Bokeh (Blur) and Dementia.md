		- His only request was about spelling of "ぼけ"
			- not "ボケ"
		- ”ぼけ” means dementia in the context of this interview
			- "ぼけ" also means "blur" in Japanese
				- also known as bokah in photography
	- it is a very small difference
		- but the difference is important for him, 
			- or the people he faces
- dementia as blur
	- just be blur-ring
		- (we need middle verb again)
		- not diseases
