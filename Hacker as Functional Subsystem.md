	- I didn't see any literature explicit on this. So...chat GPT says:
	- ### **1.** **Operational Closure via Communication**
		- Each subsystem is **operationally closed**, meaning it processes only its own type of communication.
		- For example, the **legal system** only processes communication in terms of **legal/illegal**, regardless of economic or moral considerations.
	- ### **2.** **Binary Coding (Leitdifferenz)**
		- Every functional subsystem operates using a specific **binary code** that guides its communications:
		    - **Law**: legal / illegal
		    - **Economy**: payment / non-payment
		    - **Politics**: power / no power
		    - **Science**: true / false
		- This code acts as a **filter** for relevant communication
	- ### **3.** **Programmatic Guidance**
		- In addition to a binary code, each subsystem has **programs**—rules or decision criteria—to guide decisions when the binary code alone isn’t enough.
		    - E.g., in law: statutes, precedents, and legal doctrines
		    - In science: methodologies, peer review processes
	- ### **4.** **Functional Specificity**
		- The subsystem fulfills a **distinct social function**—e.g., the legal system stabilizes normative expectations, the economy facilitates resource distribution.
		- These functions cannot be completely replaced by another system.
	- ### **5.** **Autopoiesis**
		- The system must be **self-producing** through its own operations (communications). That is, only legal communication can produce more legal communication, only scientific statements can trigger more scientific statements, etc
	- ### **6.**  **Structural Coupling**
		- Subsystems **interact indirectly** with each other through **structural couplings**—mechanisms that allow coordination without violating operational closure.
		    - Example: science informs policy via advisory boards, not by becoming politics.
	- ### **Optional but Often Present:**  **Globalization and Decentralization**
		- Functional systems are often **globally operative**, with **no single center of control** (e.g., there is no central economic or scientific authority worldwide).
- What are these in each Functional Subsystem?
