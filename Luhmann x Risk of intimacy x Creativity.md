| **Probability of Understanding** | High (due to shared norms and procedures) | Low (requires deep personal interpretation, often ambiguous)   |
| **Risk**                         | Low; roles and outcomes are predictable   | High; always risks rejection, misinterpretation, vulnerability |


- The **threshold problem** of love:
	- set itself apart from all other relationships through unique personal reference
- Intimacy means: 
	- communicate in a way that **cannot be substituted** or generalized
- As society becomes more functionally differentiated:
	- love is the (paradoxical) space for individualization and emotional resonance
