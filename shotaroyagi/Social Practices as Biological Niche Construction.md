* I started reading Joseph Rouse's book! 
* https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo202330194.html
	* Rouse merges practice theory with niche construction in biology, arguing that human social practices evolved as biologically active environments that shape and are shaped by human beings.
	* He rejects the age-old separations of “nature vs society,” “mind vs body,” offering a naturecultural framework that deeply integrates embodiment, ecology, and sociality.
	* Crucially, he develops a two-dimensional notion of normativity, grounded both in biological survival and in socio-discursive practices—this creates space for normativity that’s both evolutionarily rooted and socially contested.
* He engage with Robert Brandom, critically.
	* Rouse critiques Brandom’s inferentialism *by turning it inside out*. Instead of reasoning entering the world from language use, Rouse argues that language itself is built within biologically constructed niches.
	* He reframes Brandom’s space of reasons as emerging from ecological and developmental embodiment, expanding inferentialism into a ‘naturecultural inferentialism’—where reasoning is grounded in practice-environment coordination.
* His theory seems to contribute to the theory of resonance (and modal construction)
	* It shares Barad’s material-discursive ontology but embeds it in evolution and embodied development—a powerful model for your “resonant, responsible emergence” thesis.
	* Niche construction provides an empirical and theoretical mechanism for how practices consolidate over time.
