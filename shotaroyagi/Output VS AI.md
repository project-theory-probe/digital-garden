* I have written about [[Plasticity]]
	* Plastic has 3 meanings:
		* Take form
		* Give form
		* Explode
* The pathology of modern society is that it focuses on flexibility which only focus on the first (take form).
	* There we ope with the world by trying to output something that is predictable.
* AI is also built around honing the prediction.
	* Generative AI predicts the next token given the previous token
* Is the predicted "next token" the JECT?
	* I would say *no*.
	* Because the JECT is not the normal prediction based on the structure of reality.
	* JECT is about changing the structure of reality in a disruptive manner.
* However, if we humans continue to operate JECT (disrupting the reality based on the reality) then AI may ultimately learn how to JECT.
	* But for the time being, it is up to us (not AI) to inhabit there practices that  are ontologically aware.
	* And at least, predict-based model of AI wouldn't disrupt the "creativeness" of our creatives.
* This coincides with Shaun Gallagher's 4E cognition. 
	* He explains that Free Energy Principle tries to explain people's activity using the model of minimizing the entropy (surprise).
	* However, this doesn't explain the "enactive" mode of cognition where it emphasizes the role of action and interaction with the world in *shaping* cognition.
		* Prediction wants to minimize free energy → close gaps → stabilize the world
		* Creativity wants to open new horizons → disrupt stability → produce novelty (& possibility)
	* In the "enactive" cognition, creativity is about creating a world that does not exist yet, not about adapting to an existing world.
* For now an easy take would be:
	* JECT is the "explode" and at least "give form."  
	* Generative AI outputs "takes form" and suggest "giving form"
* This is why AI generated output still cease to be a JECT, although it may aide our practice.
