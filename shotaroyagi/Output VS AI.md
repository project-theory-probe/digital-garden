* I have written about [[Plasticity]]
	* Plastic has 3 meanings:
		* Take form
		* Give form
		* Explode
* The pathology of modern society is that it focuses on flexibility which only focus on the first (take form).
	* There we ope with the world by trying to output something that is predictable.
* AI is also built around honing the prediction.
	* Generative AI predicts the next token given the previous token
* Is the predicted "next token" the JECT?
	* I would say *no*.
	* Because the JECT is not the normal prediction based on the structure of reality.
	* JECT is about changing the structure of reality in a disruptive manner.
* However, if we humans continue to operate JECT (disrupting the reality based on the reality) then AI may ultimately learn how to JECT.
	* But for the time being, it is up to us (not AI) to inhabit there practices that  are ontologically aware.
* For now an easy take would be:
	* JECT is the "explode" and at least "give form."  
	* Generative AI outputs "takes form" and suggest "giving form"
* This is why AI generated output still cease to be a JECT, although it may aide our practice.
