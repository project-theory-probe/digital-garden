- Here I explained how GIT was a game changer, and why project management can be seen as a variation of it.

- We are building space of reasons, where material and our knowledge has equal value as the building blocks:
	- Material (output) has it's pragmatic qualities which are *predictable*
	- Knowledge makes the whole situation *understandable* and *predictable*
- Both works as a means to raise predictability of the situation at hand.
	- OSS focus on the former as software demonstrates versatile and reproducible function while it is sharable
	- Other forms of project (have no other choice but to) focus on the latter as their outputs are not complete and situational
- In the latter case, the conversation about the output material is crucial to build the predictability of the situation and have shared understandings amongst the participants.
	- By discussing what it is (which is constituted of what it *does* and *what has to be done* to be regarded as such) we are sharing the pragmatic understanding of the world around the output.
		- “This part doesn’t work” → pragmatic debate about functions, not abstractions.
	- Thus, discussing about the output is actually about discussing about the world and building a shared understanding (ontology) on it.
	- Those are the "quasi-language" for the project to intervene with the world it cares about.
- To have new thing is to have new relationship and see how they are. It is not only seeing the quality of the new output but also the existing things.
	* Thus this ontic operation adds to the ontology which is also a learning in terms of the world.
		* To create A′ is to recompose the relational field in which A, B, C already exist.
	* A to B is one of the expression of the quality it has with other beings. 
	* Without this ontic operation we wouldn’t have the ontology actualized although we can hold it virtually.
	* Without such ontic acts, ontology remains virtual — a dream like a fictional world, internally coherent but unactualized.
	
- In other words, what we are building is the normative articulation of the situation where outputs and utterance enables/limits consequent actions.
	- According to Brandom, every assertion is the commitment. It is the commitment that pushes where it would be regarded as accepted (and merged) if no one questions.
	- But this commitment is only done for the interlocutor. That is why minutes are important as a mean to expand the interlocutor to the absent or future members.

* The output is pulls the project together.
	* Only the shipped output fixes a shared referent.
	* It becomes a **quasi-object** (Serres): a thing that mediates relations, stabilizes meaning, and lets coordination scale.
* Outcome talks back:
	* The excitement comes from seeing bias destroyed through prototyping
	* That resonance — seeing one’s thought act in the world — is intrinsically rewarding.
	* It gives agency-feedback: the sense that the world responds to you. 
		* Resonance.

* However, the latter is fragile since we cannot testify whether the commitment actually *works*. 
* Especially in the project where you are creating something novel, you would ultimately face a commit that cannot be testify unless it is actually *tested*.
	* This is why we need to output or have a field research.
* Here, we are discussing about the structure of the space of reasons.
	* If a member doesn't play the game of giving and asking reasons, he/she is out of the game.
	* But if all members failed to testify, the whole space of reasons would collapse.

* That said, it doesn't mean that the latter stays the latter.
	* Project would eventually end with accomplishing the former, where its output makes desired function.
		* From start to finish, project represents a functor (A→B)
		* The elements of the functor gradually gets replaced from the latter to former, becoming more and more material.
	* Thus, any project can be seen as raising the predictability of the world for *others* (including the future self).

* This is the synthesis of OSS and project (sprint). They are structurally the same, differs in the parameters. 
* However, the key ground is its material output. Without putting it into the heart of the practice, we lose touch with what matters in the project (thus PJS v4).
	* Output is a hack on cognition; cognition is a reconfiguration of output. The loop between them — sustained by artifacts, conversations, and revisions — is what constitutes project life.
* Project as Ontological Design
	* means treating every act of making, organizing, or managing as a contribution to the world’s evolving ontology—a recursive conversation between reason and reality, in which we do not just build things, but help the world learn how to exist differently.
