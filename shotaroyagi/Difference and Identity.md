* In Issue I wrote about [[diffraction]] and reflection.
	* To me the distinction resembles that of poking and ping(-pong).
* Haruma and I also discussed how ping(-pong) scheme was fundamental to the computer networks. 
* Even TCP(Transport Control Protocol) has 3498 protocols [https://www.gasmi.net/tcp.php](https://www.gasmi.net/tcp.php)
	* The protocol allows any foreign and heterogeneous machines to communication with each others.
	* They open port and wait for signal. This system is invented in the age of thin telephone network. It is effective and seems (semi-)natural.
	* In other words these computer networks are built upon identity (protocol).
* Thus my question, should we think of the world as built upon difference or identity?
	* Deleuze says Difference is ontologically primary
	* Luhmann says his theory is based upon difference
* There seems to be 4 layers
	* Primary distinction based on the difference (A/not A)
	* Identical mark (call/protocol)
		* Which is a second-order observation (re-entry) based on the difference (call/not call)
		* But also can be questioned from this layer ([[diffraction]])
* It is very nuanced...
