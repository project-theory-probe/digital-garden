## **“Ontology” is a stance (one step back from cognition)**

* When philosophers use “ontology,” they’re not naming a hidden layer of reality. They’re naming the assumptions that make reality show up the way it does.
	- If you treat a project as a sequence of tasks, the world you live in becomes one of _tasks and deadlines_.
	- If you treat a project as a space of learning, the world you live in becomes one of _experiments and feedback_.
- The word _ontology_ just names those background lenses that determine what kinds of things are even visible or actionable.
- It’s not cosmic; it’s perspectival. 
- When you ask “How would I know this is true?” the answer is: 
	- you notice whether a different ontology lets you see and act differently.
## **The test for ontology is experiential, not propositional**

* You can’t “prove” ontology like a physics equation. You can only observe the shift in affordances that comes from adopting one or another frame.
* Let's say we try this experiment:
	- Run a project treating output as _deliverable_: the goal is to finish.
	- Run another treating output as _question_: something meant to test how the world responds.
- We’ll feel a qualitative change — in motivation, attention, and meaning. That difference *is* ontology at work. It’s how a concept rewires what’s thinkable and doable.
- So you don’t verify ontology; you inhabit it and see what becomes possible.
## **Why “ontology” still matters**

* It’s tempting to drop the word because it sounds abstract. But keeping it does something useful: it reminds you that what seems practical (“make this output”) always carries a theory of what exists and matters.
* When you ship an output, you aren’t just adding a thing to the world. You’re confirming a certain idea of what counts as “real,” “valuable,” “complete,” “alive.” That is ontology in action.
* Being aware of that layer gives you freedom: you can choose or redesign the world you’re part of, instead of being unconsciously shaped by it.
## **How to know if it’s meaningful enough**  

* Three pragmatic questions:
	1. **Does this framing change what I notice?**
	    * If seeing projects as ontological design makes you perceive new dynamics, that’s evidence of its truth.
	2. **Does it change how I act?**
	    * If you start prototyping differently — not to finish but to learn — you’ve enacted a new ontology.
	3. **Does it change what outcomes feel meaningful?**
	    * If “works / not works” becomes a dialogue with the world rather than a scorecard, the ontology is working.
* Meaningfulness here means transformative adequacy. It works because it changes your relation to the world in a coherent, generative way.
## **SUMMARY**

* “Ontology” is just the invisible grammar of reality we’re using.
	* You don’t prove it. But instead you test-drive it.
* If the project starts to _think back_ — if the world starts teaching you through your own outputs — then the ontology is already real, because it’s doing work.
