* I am writing a paper to provide a different perspectives to the SECI model (or Knowledge Creation Theory) which was proposed by Nonaka & Takeuchi in 1990. The model & theory have long been cited heavily in innovation studies.
* The problem of their model, however, is that they are anthropocentric. This is more of a theoretical issue than an ethical issue. SECI model faces struggle when they admit the existence of tacit knowledge -the knowledge that people are unaware until they investigate- while admitting agency to only human beings. How can we access anything that are out of our consciousness while we are the only one who can enact them? These presuppositions hinders people to actually understand how their tacit knowledge works, et alone utilize them.
* A way to resolve this is to shed lights on matters/objects. Namely, the new materialism and OOO should help SECI model to overcome this dilemma. 
* Graham Harman, the advocate of OOO, hasn't further explained how to apply OOO to analyze human-object/object-object transactions. So I came to illustrate some of those examples using his "quadruple-object" diagram.

* This is the quadruple-object. This shows how real things manifests to the perceiver as sensual object/qualities. For harman, object in itself is inaccessible. It *withdraws* from any scrutiny that it will never be illustrated/explained fully by our perception.
* This is the original diagram I translated from the book "How Matter Matters."

*  This is the diagram that I created to illustrate an example of perfume making.

* The great merit of these illustration is that it allows us to depict and analyze how things interact with each others based on how they (human/objects) sense other beings.
* It also enable us to see how things (and our perceptions) interact with one another. I will share the details once I published the paper.
