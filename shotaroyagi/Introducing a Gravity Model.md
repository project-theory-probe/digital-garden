* I wrote about the difference between JECT and the output from generative AI ([[Output VS AI]]).
* In AI or Free Energy Principle it was prediction and "minimizing the entropy" that was the index of the operation.
* What would the objective be for the ontological design with JECT and SPECT?
* In other words, when we do those practice what are we *aiming to do* and *how do we know* if it is good enough?
* Would it be...to have a gravity?
	* JECT is aimed to be irresistible (顔ベロベロ)
	* This irresistibility is analogical to gravity.
* Gravity...
	* is not a property of objects — it is a property of relations
	* creates structure by expanding possibilities
	* repositions everything around it
	* is not something to evaluate. It is an attraction
		* SPECT = being sensitive to how the ject curves the space.
	* creates new affordance
		* spacetime curvature of the project world.
* Ontological “betterment” = deeper gravitational wells
	- Better means the ject creates more curvature.
	- More curvature means more relational reorganization    
	- More relational reorganization means more affordances available.
	- More affordances means the world becomes richer.
- This is the opposite of free-energy-minimization (flattening).
	- This is free-energy-_expansion_ via world-making.
- Analogy of gravity:
	- In General Relativity:
		- mass and energy curve the manifold
		- curvature determines possible trajectories
		- new masses create _new geometry_
	- In JECT–SPECT:
		- a ject is like a mass insert
		- it changes the relational geometry
		- it generates new trajectories of thought, action, and meaning
		- it makes a new world appear
* In short:
	* Prediction = flattening curvature (minimizing surprise).
	* Creativity = generating curvature (introducing new relational potentials).
* The new object (JECT) pull people in, reorient their attention, and create shared direction (curvature = gravity)
	* This “pull” behaved exactly like gravity:
		- the object’s presence reshapes how others move
		- relations curve around the object
		- trajectories naturally change without forcing    
		- people become able to act more freely because of the shared curvature
		- new relationships emerge
- Curvature
	- The curvature determines geodesics, the “straightest possible” paths.
	- Objects in free fall follow geodesics.
	- Gravity = curvature = objects following curved geodesics. 
	- It is the emergent pattern of:
		- attention
		- interpretation
		- prediction
		- coordination (incl. time)
		- commitment
		- meaning
		- pull or resist
	- that forms around the object.
	- The change of the "path" is what we would have been calling "pragmatic difference"
- Gravity
	- Gravity is not force but instead...
		- spacetime is curved
		- objects naturally move along this curvature
		- this motion looks like a force
	- Gravity is neither psychological nor symbolic. It is relational shift in how beings can move in a shared space.
	- People act differently not because they aligned, but because the object reshaped the space of possible action.
- Pull of Gravity
	- This is actually geodesic deviation (how nearby free-falling paths diverge.)
	- The pull is omnipresent and is a huge part of the object force
		- But we tend to forget (gravity) because it is so omnipresent.

* Gravity model explains:
	* Why some projects move and others don’t.
	* Projects fail not due to lack of alignment or planning, but because:
		- nothing in the field has sufficient gravity
		- outputs are too weak
		- objects lack identity
		- people respond abstractly
		- the field has no curvature
- The Gravity Model gives:
	- A new explanation for motivation and momentum
		- People move when the object pulls them in.
	- A new way to design outputs
		- JECTs must be identity-stable and response-able.
	- A new way to diagnose stagnation
		- If nothing has gravity, the field is flat.
	- A new practice of worldmaking
		- Use JECT/SPECT to shape relational curvature deliberately.
	- A new measure of project health
		- Not alignment, not velocity, but curvature.
	- A way to incorporate autopoiesis and sympoiesis
		- Objects reproduce the project (autopoiesis) and entangle it with the world (sympoiesis).
	- A path to ontological design
		- By shaping gravity, you shape the world people inhabit.
- gravity + intimacy + creativity are the same ontological movement
	- Gravity
		- Matter curves spacetime → things fall into meaningful relation.
	- Intimacy
		- Other people curve your emotional world → you fall into vulnerability and responsiveness.
	- Creativity (JECT–SPECT)
		- A ject curves the relational field → people fall into new positions, interpretations, affordances.
	- To be pulled is to be alive whereas to resist all pull is to die.
- Also pragmatic
	- Gravity is the curvature that define how the objects move (we call it a force).
	- In same manner, the space defines how things are pragmatic and in what way. 
	- With gravity we can move around and swing by. The more different (and beneficial) move it allows, the richer. 
		- Swing-by as affordance expansion.
		- Participants can perform actions they could not previously perform
		- They can redirect their thinking or practice using the ject as a gravitational well
	- That object will be enacted repeatedly, recognized as existence.
- However, this theory tells that gravity can come before pragmatics (ontology before behavior)
	- In physics, curvature comes first. Force is derivative.
	- The world is not only the web of pragmatics (objects are not there not to be useful nor because they have been useful)
		- first reasons → then decisions → then behavior.
	- Intimacy, affinity, attraction and worlding comes first.
	- Intimacy
		- = low-friction geodesics between two relational bodies.
		- Two people who share intimacy:
			- move freely in each other’s presence
			- can take actions they cannot take elsewhere
			- speak in ways they cannot speak elsewhere
			- may think differently, feel differently, imagine differently as a result
	- Creative attraction = gravitational wells of possibility
		- first gravity → then relation → then trajectories → then reasons → then behavior.
- That said, ontology and pragmatics can be yin and yang. 
	- c.f. Robert Brandom's MUR (Meaning-Use Relationship)
	- Gravity creates pragmatics, but also certain pragmatics (JECT) shapes gravity.
