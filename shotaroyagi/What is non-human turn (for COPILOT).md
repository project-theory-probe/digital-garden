I think it is very practical. It is about meddling with quasi nature by making a quasi language. We do it all the time but somehow we forget about artifact and social dimension of our being.

I feel it is also about acknowledging that our action is not controlled by the will of ours. We are the sum of our communication and the mangle with materials. 

What does these insights bring about? I think that is a deep understanding and deep engineering of ourselves. But that ourselves are not only us humans but also all the worldly entanglements. 

It is as if we are hacking. We invent languages that understand and work with the very nature we entangled with. We start by understanding them. We build artifact that works in that realm. We hack it continuously until we get what we need. We have been doing that for a long time. Now it is a time to democratize it, make it *convivial.* 

This acknowledgement will leads to the fact that COPILOT is bridging between these different system. We are the programme makers of the autonomous ecosystem. 

That said, I think the role of explorer would be to build a software that bridges our understandings of project into a practice. That is, to have quasi-language and user interfaces that enables the quasi-natural way of coordination.

In order to do so, I need to be working in a very practical level. Instead of being lofty, I need to explain how this non-human turn can be exemplified and utilized in our work places in practice.
