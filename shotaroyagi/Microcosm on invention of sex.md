* Microbiome have different mechanism for exchanging genetic information.
	* The need for repairing damage on DNA was high, due to the strong rays of ancient sun.
	* In the course of evolution, replicons has appeared which they repair the damaged genes using available amino acids at hand.
	* The replicons usually use their own genetic materials, but sometimes it borrows DNA from their neighbor bacteria.
	* This enables regular genetic transformation through repairing. This microcosmic "sex" not only doesn't require replication, but also enable radical transformation (e.g. 80% of genetic information changes as a result of repairing)
	* This is why microbiome literary relates and mutates horizontally, compared with mammals only exchanging genes through programmed sex and only see it's effect generationally.
* Information are shared like DNA in microcosm. Should we deem project to go through generational mutation, or instead, microcosmic sex?
