* The reason why we started PTP was to probe. To gain insights

* We aimed to expand our previous initiatives called "Quest" into public so as to call for collaborators/sponsors/creators.
* Our intent was to create intersection between academic, prototype, thoughts and expression.

The Series:
* Want to see an self-organizing project
	* I started this series to show our "tunnel opening" which is the perspectives we share to view our practices (including projects, cultures etc).
	* In other words, I wanted to lay out an ontological shift in project management realm, while connecting it to pragmatism, auto-poiesis and many more.
* The frontier project
	* The project is normally associated with "executing," which is a flow from left to right in the double diamond.
	* But what about right to left? We called it *Arabic*. There should be a projects which does this. We wanted to see why it was and how it is possile.
