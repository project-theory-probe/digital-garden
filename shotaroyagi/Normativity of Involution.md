- The summary of season 1 (although I haven't reached ⑥)
	- ①human practice is linguistic from the epistemological level and 
	- ②language about practice is what accelerates the self-organization. 
	- ③Language about practice is almost given and felt as if it exists. Therefore this is ontological issues. 
	- ④However, these are rewritable through discursive practices (as every meaning is linguistically defined). Thus, 
	- ⑤the norm on discursive practices (i.e. truth seeking) is the underlying principle. 
	- ⑥this norm is contagious as it is implied by discursive practice**

- However, we are focused too much on the language
	- Even without language, we are able to create new society/community
	- We can build relationship with something outside of us
	- The practice of responding
		- Responding: 
			- Recognize/ understand/ demarcate/ naming something
			- Choice of what to take into account
				- Patterns:
					- 1. responding to substance A’s property
					- 2. responding to substance A’s function/action
					- 3. responding to what substance A created
					- 4. responding to what holoboints (including A) creates
					- 5. responding to the holoboints (including A) itself
		- Response-ablity →
		- Language(?)-game
			- how order is created
	- Because we tend to forget environment, minorities, customers, computers we have too much emphasis on internal dynamics
		- How do we connect to externals?
