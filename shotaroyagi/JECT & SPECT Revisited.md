* Theory that says any thing especially physical are inevitably meshed into the network of relationships
	* Relational ontology
	* Actor-Network Theory 
		* Objects are relational events, not substances.
		* They persist only as long as networks keep enacting them.
		* To study objects is to study the practices and associations that hold them in existence
	* Posthuman
	* New Materialism
	* Whitehead (Process Philosophy)
	* Simondon

* Exploring this relational ontology
	* This is a categorical shift: from controlling work to cultivating world-relations.	
	* **Traditional PM**
		* Focus: tasks, deadlines, deliverables
		* Ontology: project = plan + execution
		* Object: output is a goal, a milestone
		* Feedback: evaluation/judgment (“is this correct?”)
	* **Relational-Ontological PM**
		* Focus: actualizing new relations
		* Ontology: project = world-making through interaction
		* Object: output = relational node that reorganizes the field
		* Feedback: response, not evaluation (“what does this make possible?”)

* Prototype is central
	* In relational ontology, things are their relations.
	* Thus, to change reality, you don’t manage behavior — you introduce new objects that reorganize relational fields.
	* Prototyping is not a “step” but the core operational mechanism of ontological design.
	* Ject: 
		* The intentional act of producing an object that generates unavoidable relational response.
		* Making something irresistable to react is the action
		* The planning of the sprint would be to create something that relates to all in less time as possible. 
			* That is, in many case ontological impact if we are to make it impactful. 
		* This is the ANT insight: objects reorganize collectives. Ject turns that into a practice.
	* Spect:
		* The attitude of responding to the ject with sincerity and curiosity, allowing the object to disclose its relational potential.
		* The attitude of interlocutor responding to the output as sencerely as possible
		* This is not about judging it but rather seeing it from curiosity and talking in the new perspective. 
		* This viewing also requires ontological perspective, because you are seeing it in the light of the object and not yourself. 
		* It is ontological because you are seeing the world _in the light of the object_, not the object in the light of your world.
			* Mol’s idea of “attending to the enactment”
			* Barad’s “intra-acting with the phenomenon”
			* Latour’s “following the actor”
			* Rosa’s “resonant encounter”

	* Before:
		* output is seen as product
		* review is seen as evaluation
		* sprint is seen as productivity
	* In NM ontology:
		* output = ontic intervention
		* response = relational inquiry
		* sprint = act of world-making

* Project = Ontological Design Through JECTs and SPECTs
	•	JECT: producing objects that reorganize relational fields
	•	SPECT: responding with ontological sensitivity, letting the object show what world it proposes
	•	LOOP: each ject–spect cycle evolves the project-world
	•	WORLD: the project is the emerging pattern of relations stabilized through these cycles
