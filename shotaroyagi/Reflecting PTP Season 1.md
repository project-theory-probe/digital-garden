- A project is “becoming” rather than “being”
	- How we call projects and practices is important (ontological turn)
- At the origins of Agile, much more was said than is currently being said about the so-called methods.
	- Hacker culture and practices (e.g. KTP)
	- [[Christopher Alexander]]
- There is room for consideration and practice of how to launch a project while respecting each other's ontology (named Projection).
	- It has already been practiced in past production projects (Shin Evangelion), and has been tried before and after this season.
- The ontological turn discussed in cultural anthropology touches on the relationship between love, intimacy, and creativity.
	- norms of care
	- The existence of people (werewolves) who abuse these norms
- Relationship with Activism
	- Existence of a project to explore for the project to be executed
	- A project that moves from right to left in the words of Double Diamond.

I want to ask everyone the following questions:

* What was the expectation before starting/joining PTP?
* What was most enabling to you?
* What did you find other people's work the most interesting?
* Where do you think you have been now compared to where you were before?
* What are you inspired to do now?
* How can we be more creative in doing so?
