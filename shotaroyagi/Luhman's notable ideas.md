* Function
	* Luhman's social theory is based upon functionalism. But for Luhman (in his early theory), function is not about it's effect. It is about showing possible alternatives.
	* Function indicates things or events that are equally valuable in that system.
	* (Sounds like a pragmatism)
* Complexity
	* For Luhman, world-in-itself is unprescribed. It is a wave of the possibility he calls complexity. System chooses what to take into account and what not to. This selection lowers the complexity.
	* It is not agents that are making selection. They (agency themselves) are rather results of selection by the system.
	* In other words, system has its own stance and expectation towards enviroment that selects and reduces the complexity.
	* (Sounds like Karen Barad)
* Element
	* System is consisted of elements (indivisible for system) and the relationship between them. Elements are not given or predetermined. Rather, they are defined by the relationship they have with other elements.
		* (BTW element indivisible for system sounds like [[Object Oriented Ontology|OOO]], because Luhman says that construct of element can be given from different layers/dimension)
	* For any system, the relationship has to be selected. The reason is because element cannot possibly have every relationship to other elements. The number of relationships grow exponentially to the number of elements.
	* Thus, system makes division of function. Then, they relate to each other and unite as a whole system through communication.
* System of difference
	* Autopoiesis doesn't reproduce certain form. It is in fact only producing difference from environment.
	* (Sounds like it apply to the definition of project)
