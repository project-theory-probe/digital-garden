Connection: [[INTIMACY]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[involution]]


"Every generalized symbolic medium is differentiated according to a specific threshold problem."

<u>problem:</u> 
people becomes more individualized while the world still works in impersonal, generalized systems, which makes real communication between people harder

<u>threshold problem:</u>
* personal, emotional disclosure; 
* cannot be transferable or impersonal;
* itâ€™s about being **seen and chosen** as a singular person;
-> sorting personal, emotional communication

<u>symbolic medium:</u> 
love

<u>communication system:</u> 
intimacy - where people exchange personal information under trust

<u>code:</u>
- _intimate / not intimate_
- _being loved / not being loved_

<u>code must be duplicated:</u>
* i love you --> i love you, too
* must reciprocate
