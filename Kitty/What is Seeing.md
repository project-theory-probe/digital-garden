intimacy: the practice of *[[seeing]]* interdependently
when we are intimate, what do we *see*?
what is *seeing*?


![[see or represent.jpg]]

representationalism
* believes in the gap

according to Karen Barad:
* seeing doesn't create a gap
	* a gap is dualistic thinking (the eye sees ≠ the mind thinks; body ≠ mind)
* seeing isn't about "intervening from outside", but **intra-acting from within** 
	* scientists used to believe "seeing" if they can intervene with the phenomenon repeatedly
* seeing is the "**entangled material practice of knowing and becoming**"
	* a non-representationalist form of realism
		* doesn't believe in pre-existing things nor words
		* but emerge through intra-action
* seeing *may* come more accurately from touching
	* STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope): seeing through touching / "feeling"
