### Intra-actions entail **exclusions**
- a cut is always being drawn
- it iteratively reconfigures what is possible / impossible
- “possibilities do not sit still” (barad 177)
- reconfiguring: boundaries, properties, meanings, specific material phenomena (139)
- marking and making here & now (aka spacetime) = an enactment of differentness
- intra-actions and exclusions → aliveness = exuberant creativity

Thus, there must be accountability for the things we include and exclude.

Denying exclusions does not make any sense. Doing so is distortion and self-fooling. Exclusions are a must in any meeting. To meet (to encounter) is to separate. From this space of momentarily separating is agency. This act marks the abundance of creativity, always reconfiguring what is possible and impossible. Participating in such dynamism is exhilarating. I have a clue that it is a mark of the awareness of aliveness.
