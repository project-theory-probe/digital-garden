Being Visible:

- Making yourself visible, being able to be seen, transparent, conscious, awake, living.

Being in-visibility:
- Entering, stepping into visibility.
- Making invisible things seen/known.

But visibility is difficult because it takes 2 or more people. 
It is not up to one person's free will.
It needs another subject who chooses to see.
