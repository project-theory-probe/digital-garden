Autism
* is a spectrum
* there is something called...
	* hyper-empathetic autism
		* affected by everyone's emotions to the extreme
		* hyper sensitive fight-flight-freeze response
		* lack a clear hierarchy of emotional experiences: meltdown
	* gifted (2E or twice-exceptional) autism
		* rapid pattern recognition across disciplines
		* hyper-visual and creative
* alongside many challenges, unlisted here

historically, autistic people are misunderstood as "unable to empathize"
*  [Double Empathy Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_empathy_problem) says that
	* they do experience empathy, just different from non-autistic people
	* but they are categorized as disabled

question:
* can a space recognize all types of empathy?
	* what patterns would that place have?
