### Recruitment method at NASA

* ==Situation:== 1980s, NASA started working on international space station where astronauts may have to live up to 1 year in a crowded space together.
* ==Problem:== Breakdown in communication. Isolation and crowdedness cause depression and/or distress behaviors. 
* ==Solution:== Need to screen for astronauts with high [[emotional intelligence]], who could monitor their feelings and are sensitive to others' emotions, and could connect with colleagues, even when tensions were running high.
* ==Method:== Interviewer, Terence McGuire, scans for both verbal and nonlinguistic expressions.
* Quest: Did it seem like they wanted to connect? 
* ==Example 1:== McGuire shares personal experiences (e.g. his sister's death) and sees how the interviewee would reciprocate with a vulnerable story.
* ==Example 2:== McGuire asks candidates to describe their own emotional lives.
* ==Example 2:== McGuire varies his mood and energy levels and watch if the applicant would match up or not. ([[Matching Principle]] in building intimacy)



#### From [[Terance McGuire]]:

> "Virtually all astronaut selectees have strong cognitive bases. But it is a minority that have great awareness or [[SENSITIVITY]] at a feeling level." 

> "We needed the best of the best, and that meant people who were exceptional at emotional intelligence."

> "Long-term confinement in crowded quarters is generally less stressful for those whose [[SENSITIVITY]] and [[EMPATHY]] allow them to recognize human problems earlier and to engage them effectively."


#### Emotional Intelligence:

> "These individuals are aware of their own feelings and those of others. They are open to positive and negative aspects of internal experience, are able to label them, and when appropriate, communicate them... The emotionally intelligent person is often a pleasure to be around and leaves others feeling better. The emotionally intelligent person, however, does not mindlessly seek pleasure, but rather attends to emotion in the path toward growth."

#### Nonlinguistic:

> [[nonlinguistic language]] are signals as to whether someone genuinely wants to connect, and if they are good at doing so, or if they didn't consider emotional bonding to be much of a priority. If someone could connect this way during an interview, they'd also be good at aligning with colleagues in space.

Terance was collaborating with another psychologist, Dr. Taibi Kahler, who worked on [Transactional Analysis Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis). They executed the practice called [Process Communication Model ](https://processcommunicationmodel.com/)for fast assessment of personality.
