The (initial) purposes of season 2.



According to Alexander, the strength of a center is a measure for its organizational and living quality. Thus, the design of centers must be undertaken with the utmost care. Alexander researched thousands of systems of nature, art, and architecture, to trace back the perceived quality of life to simpler characteristics, which he then identified 15 properties that repeat again and again in living systems.

**I want to understand the architecture of human intimacy.** In PTP Season 1, I have discovered how the architecture of human relationships is a reflection of whether projects create revolutionary changes that transform the existing power structure or hierarchy.

Alexander sees design as the art of creating living order in systems. Doing it well is the desire to give a building as much life as possible.
Then I see intimacy as the art of creating living order in human complex relational network ("relational systems"). Doing it well is the desire to give a relation as much life as possible.

In design language, the mechanistic world view has destructive consequences for the artist. In humanity language, the mechanistic world view has destructive consequences for the human relationships, thus, the human's life.

## The purposes of the [following series](obsidian://open?vault=digital-garden&file=Kitty%2FPossible%20paths%20for%20season%202):

1. Increase the chance of meaningful observations and experiences.
	* Create a cultural landscape.
2. Give us a proper language to communicate them.

building a language (vocabulary) 
→ pattern 
→ environment to create a living order in all systems

Like how the philosopher Jeremy Bentham designed the [Panopticon prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon), which allows a central guard to observe prisoners without himself being observed; Or the economist Dimitry Davidoff designed the [Mafia game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) to show how an informed minority (the Mafia) when pitted against an uninformed majority (the villagers) will usually win; Or the Temazcal ceremony in Mayan tradition where a shaman leads participants through 4 steps ("doors") that to rebirth; Or the Philosopher Stone in Alchemy.
	what is a simple way to build an architecture that can communicate, explore this new language?

If I were to build a house/ritual/game that represents human intimacy, how?
What will be included? What questions will be posed?
Should I just share experiences of creating events/rituals for Từ Từ?
