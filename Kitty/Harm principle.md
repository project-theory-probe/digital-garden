"we must move beyond fragmented experiences of intimacy toward a systemic framework: an Architecture of Intimacy that actively promotes safety of voice (ie. visibility), thus sustaining diverse ontologies and multitudes of truth"

* Architecture of Intimacy depends on safety.
* I'm looking for the kind of ontology that minimizes harm.

Introduced by [[Nel Noddings]]:

Justice-based system:
* believe in fairness
* believe some deserve punishment
* believe pain is necessary

Autonomy-based system (liberalism):
* freedom as most important value
* no interference in each other's life

Care-based system:
* no punishment, guidance instead
* seek to reduce all harm
* believe pain needs alleviation
