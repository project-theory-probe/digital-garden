#### Changes for seasons 2:

Possible paths Kitty wants to pursue:



# 1. Visual blog: metaconversation
Conversations about conversation.

What makes a wholesome conversation?
A short comic strip that converse about conversations: contrast how conversations "normally go" and how a shift in language can lead to a more wholesome, joyous and loving conversation, thus, more collaborative story and relationships.

* Shift our language ontology to love instead of fear.
	* Connectedness instead of separateness
* Maybe explore:
	* Erin Kissane, [[Christopher Alexander]], Jan Gehl 
	* Buddhist texts (and where Buddhism failed?)
	* Integral Theory by Ken Wilber: Levels of Consciousness
	* Methods that has worked for trauma treatment (EMDR, yoga, neuro-feedback) 
	* The Invention of Tradition 
		* Aestheticization of politics (Walter Benjamin)

For example, I find many commonalities between decolonial activism and empathy-based conversations. The 2 fields, decolonial studies (for example, Critical Race Theory, which talks about society as a whole) and the private sphere of conversations overlap. But there is no language for them yet. Thus, activism is not used in daily life wisdom and vice versa. But as I mentioned in [What's Love* Got To Do With Intimacy?](https://ptp.voyage/journal/12/#whatslovegottodowithit):

> revolutionary actions must reconstitute our social relations in ways that are different from the domination in which we oppose ( [[David Graeber]] )

### Medium:
[Visual blog](https://open.substack.com/pub/tutuhouse/p/how-to-hug?r=3h3eub&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).

<iframe src="https://tutuhouse.substack.com/p/how-to-hug" style="width:100%; height:500px;overflow:auto;"></iframe>

### Question:
* Should I document existing rituals (eg Nonviolent Communication), or real-life conversation I have, or fictional dialogue (like Sho's comic)?
* Should I just share experiences of creating events/rituals for [[Từ Từ]]?

# 2. Photography: The architecture of intimacy
Explore spatial elements that create intimacy.

Explore the relationship between space and community (:the feeling of coziness, being home, or creativity) by writing about a community space each month and do fieldwork analysis.

* The feeling of intimacy creates a human environment for individuals within it to be themselves and self-actualize.
* Show the interplay of architect/design with emotional sphere/experience.
* Explore:
	* Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander
	* Understand Pattern Language by exploring actual spaces. 
* Possible examples:
	* [Ném Space](https://www.instagram.com/nem.space/)
	* [Mat Nagoya](https://www.mat-nagoya.jp/)

### Question:
* Should I explore local examples? Or big, notable examples?
* What is the metric for an "intimate space"? Perhaps we can have a metric after 12 articles?But where shall I start with right now?
* Explore public spaces (park, street, cafe, studio). How about private spaces like a kitchen or home?

----
# 3. Make installation on intimacy with artists

Frequency: Every 3 months.
Make something physical with a local artist that creates a small prototype for intimate space.
	* This is a tool that enable triangulation connection (like busking).
	* Has a prototype: Easy to replicate anywhere in the world.
	* Example: something so simple like "A Hugging Circle": drawing a circle on the ground and anyone who comes in there are hugged.

----
# 4. Build a Questionnaire

Questions from a friend:
* Should I have called them out?
* What can I do for them to admit it?
* In projects, there are things to be done, how is the importance of truth?
* What kind of interviewing questions that we can ask to not pick a narcissist? (identify takers from givers)

----
# 5. Anti-Virus Architecture

* Power & Play
* Transparency
* Artifacts
* Eggshells

### A "date" with PTP contributors

Frequency: Every 3 months.
Meta-conversation with PTP contributor to explore each other's ontologies.
