each relationship is like a cosmos, with its own ...
* habits/reflex
* environment
* language

exploring relational life is a whole cosmos
* exploring a map not a person-to-person
* which cosmos is "worth" promoting?
* understanding cosmos is beyond affect

Whitehead says there are 2 kinds of perception:
1. causal efficacy
	* before reflection or recognition
	* affective
2. presentational immediacy
	* sense-data

but intimacy needs both

seeing something intimately:
3 criteria:
1. see a person's differences / uniqueness (separational or differential patterns)
2. see oneness (beyond separation)
3. see "taboo" (no dichotomy)
