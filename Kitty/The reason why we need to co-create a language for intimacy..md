Although I use the word “architecture”—a physical structure, which is the association that I want to inspire in readers, I wrote about intimacy starting with the **_metaphysical_ _infrastructure_** such as _separation or relational ontologies_, sociopolitical values like _justice_, _autonomy_, _care_ and _desert_ (deserving), as well as neural phenomenon like _neural entrainment_, and introducing the vocabulary _in/visibility._ This is done consciously from the insight that…

1. World-building attempts—starting with physical alteration—are productive but with great limitations, and progress has been severely halted. Despite our widespread adoption of placemaking, walkable cities, and human-centered urban planning, not much progress has been made in terms of uplifting disparity, war-mindset, polarization, and discrimination.
    
    In the so-called developed countries, there has been a significant wave of using public policy to (re)configure positive interpersonal phenomenon (such as empathy, sympathy, trust, or recognition) and communal phenomenon (such as feelings of belonging, we-experiences, shared emotions, common values, or social norms), again, the focus has been on concrete physical structures like
    
    - promoting third spaces (cafes, libraries, parks, and gym)
    - increasing kind narratives
    - building and maintaining shared spaces (staircases, laundry room, lower-fence)
    
    Yet, pronounced difficulty is still recorded (Neal et al. 2019).
    
2. I don’t want to start with localizing intimacy by going into interpersonal interactions (like friendship) or place-based practices (like placemaking) because the immediate focus on geographical localization creates a dualistic view of lives “online and offline”, “here and elsewhere”, “we and them”, “human and non-human” etc. Such duality is the heart of what obstructs intimacy in the first place. To be intimate—_truly seeing and understanding in the way that organically brings forth a caring response-ability_—is a way of being, an ontology!
3. Intellectual theorizing alone does not help the problem we are trying to solve. For example, despite the wave of New Materialism which upholds interdependence, inter-species and relational ontology through introducing useful vocabularies like intra-action, indeterminacy, and so on, there is still a wide gap in bringing this language to world-building practices. To be frank, they are being kept behind high gates of Western academia, jargons, and intellectual debates in developed nations without any practical implications, say, on the life of a people in the war zone of Myanmar.

I want to explore how interdependence, from an intellectual concept or fragmented infrastructural attempts, can come forth as a strong and generative revolution. My proposal is the phenomenon _intimacy_—the way of seeing and understanding that organically bring forth response-ability—is a concrete, borderless, social practice which reinforces the insight of interdependence, and can be part of any world-building practices, including

- narrative-based practices (storytelling, movies, archives, museums)
- infrastructural practices (urban planning, architecture, placemaking)
- pedagogy design (student-centered learning, care-based education)
- organizational practices

But if there is not enough _existing language_ to talk about intimacy—the human practice of seeing interdependence—then it is hard to participate in world-building. Creating a language, though, is not only about thinking deeply (which is time spent in theorizing), but also time spent in the world participating; Only then, the language we create is grounded, situated, and embodied. Thus, participatory research is always crucial in the making of new social theories from a lens of interdependence (or new materialist).
