How to use objects to enhance human interactions?

With [Hiếu](https://duonggiahieu.xyz/), I'm conducting a series of social experiments at [Ném](https://www.instagram.com/nem.space/) to create an object that test out 3 foundational dimensions of intimacy:

	Needs: 
    1. Be seen for our INDIVIDUALITY / UNIQUENESS
    2. Be seen for our SHARED HUMANITY
    3. Be seen for our SUFFERINGS

We choose a lamp that has 4 buttons to turn on 4 colors:
* Yellow: I need you to see my identity.
* Red/Orange: I need to discover common grounds with you.
* Soft Purple: I need you to see my sufferings.
* White: Participant gives the meaning autonomously.

The participating pair will dialogue by switching buttons on the lamp to signal which conversation they are engaging in.

# GOALS

- Explore how objects can improve human relationships.
- Does externalizing our needs aid with communication?
- Are those 3 needs needed for intimacy?
- Explore how to simplify the communication of those needs through object.
- What are the needs that actually facilitate the feeling of intimacy?

# HOW TO CONDUCT

A. Methods:

- Laboratory-based Observational research
- Behavioral coding
- [**Conversation analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_analysis)
- Interaction analysis
- Survey

B. Steps:

1. Team agrees on hypothesis.
2. Create a Minimum Viable Product to test the hypothesis.
3. Invite testers to lab (Ném) and interact with MVP.
4. Get informed consent from testers.
    - details
        testers should know the purpose of the study, how the data will be used, and their right to confidentiality and privacy
5. Pilot test.
6. Film the interaction.
7. Have testers fill out survey.
8. Analyze data/film.
9. Draw conclusions.
10. Retest step 1 to 7 until satisfied.
11. Communicate the result.

We are using a Data Triangulation (combining observational data - behavioral coding - survey data) to ensure a systematic, evidence-based approach to understanding human behavior.

C. More things to consider:

- Contextual Variations
	Conduct latter experiments in a different spaces to see how environment affects the interaction.
