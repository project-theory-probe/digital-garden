### BRAIN
[[Neural entrainment]]
* Situation: When we click with someone.
* Other names: neural simultaneity, neural coupling, one brain, between-brain synchronization
* What happens: 
	* eyes dilate in tandem
	* hearts beat in similar pattern
	* electrical pulses within craniums synchronize
	* electrical impulses along the skin synchronize
	* feel same emotions
	* start to complete each other's sentences in our heads
