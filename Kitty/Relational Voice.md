In [In A Different Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Different_Voice), [Carol Gilligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Gilligan) wrote about:
	The difference between Justice (moralities based on reasoning, usually spoken by men) and Care (moralities based on relationships, usually spoken by women).
		* Gilligan calls the Voice that comes from Care: Relational Voice.
		* Women's ethics are based on their Care for Relationships, but are seen as inferior to men's thinking. So women mute their voice (Choose Invisibility) in order to be in relationships. What a contradiction!
		* A new definition of Immorality: 
			* An abdication/absence of voice
			* This process is called Dissociation:
				* A creation of an inner division of self, or psychic split.
			--> A disappearance from Relationships and Responsibility.
	* Relational Voice: means staying in connection (logic of care: interbe, interconnectedness, awareness of empathy), not separation (logic of men: autonomy, violence, division, boundaries, self-hood)
	* You can hear the dissonance and relational resonance from people's voices:

Quest:
* How the voice speaks in relationships?

Feminist ethics arrives from the socio-historical context, which is:
* Women intentionally don't speak / Choose Invisibility due to:
	* psychological protection
	* concerns for people's feelings
	* threat of abandonment or retaliation
	* fear others would condemn or hurt them if they spoke
* Many women find it hard to complete this sentence: "If I were to speak for myself" because they have been taught to "only act and speak for others."
