in Feminist Ethics of Care, responses in relationship are either
* survival (individualist ontology: defense and doubt) (characterizes masculine)
	OR
* care ([[relational ontology]]: interconnected and inquisitive) (characterizes feminine)
these 2 states are mutually exclusive
but masculine/feminine is not based on biological sex or mutually exclusive. 

individualist/survival becomes dominant ontology and language:
* ex. the Hero's Journey in movies and novels
	* Separation -> Initiation -> Return
* ex. business models
	* have to identify "market competitors"
* ex. Buddha's journey of enlightenment
	* left family (separation) and achieve satori, then, benefit society 
* ex. Piaget and Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development
	* self-interest -> conformity -> social contract

from mythology to business and art, our human's story is told through a masculine voice: survival responses: individualist ontology.

so where and what is the developmental model for [[relational ontology]]? 
* the story we think of human's development must change
* for X (evolved reciprocity) to be our dominant social structure
