Reflection on current process for INTIMACY article:

Hieu and I stayed up until 1AM to figure out how we could merge our fields together and create a social experiment on intimacy.

Problem:
* Hieu is talented with objects, not relationships. Actually, he is a bit autistic.
* I am talented with understanding relationships, not materials. 

Therefore, at first, we did not like, or could not understand what the other person was proposing.

Looking back, it's obvious that the path forward is to combine both of our talents and find the middle point, which means both of us have to rely on each other in order to produce this new product.

We decided on the 3 NEEDS Lamp (in [[Trouble Making and Love]]). But Hieu won't be able to conduct a safe space for human relations, while I won't be able to make the object myself.

Which is scary. Because now it is not about talents and capacity. It is our relationships that we must learn to keep.
