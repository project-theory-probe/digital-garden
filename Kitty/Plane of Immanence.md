connection: [[affect]], [[involution]], [[relational ontology]], [[time]], environmental awareness

[[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] introduced in A Thousand Plateaus: 

[[plane of immanence]]: a non-hierarchical, non-linear field of emergence and interaction
* no external structure or transcendent authority
	* example: no God, no universal truths
* no subject-object distinction — only relations, flows, assemblages
	* example: no caste-system, old-young, male-female, you-me
* pre-reflectively — before thought, identity, or recognition
* not about _what_ something is (organs/functions) but _how_ it moves and interacts (speeds/intensities)
	* it's about rate of speed
		* ontic rate of being

Karen Wendy Gilbert proposed ([[The Affective Turn]], 88):
* each life form is an ontic state that exists at its own rate of being (ie. time)

Beings with resonant rate of beings will meet.
- we assemblage by matching rhythm
- identity is secondary; relation is primary



---
* evolution: linear, hierarchical development
* involution: non-hierarchical becoming between heterogeneous beings with no predefined direction or endpoint (like probing)


[[involution]]:
* mutual transformations across a shared ontic field
* situated on the [[plane of immanence]] — where differences meet without hierarchy
* a subjectless individuation
* transformation occurs through communications between heterogenous populations (ATP 238)

* [[affective contagion]]
* [[shared rhythm]]
- [[rhizome]]
- [[assemblage]]

maybe:
- [[Body without Organs]]
- [[Spinoza’s univocity]]
- [[desiring-production]]
- [[plane of consistency]]
