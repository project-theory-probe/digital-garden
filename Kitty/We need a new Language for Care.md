# Process of CARE FOR :
![[care for.png]]

* Example:
	* A successful business man, who is also a father, listens to his son's desires to be a monk.
![[care for example.png]]
* Both father and son feels nourished and joy.

* Care For has to be DIRECT :
	* [[RESPOND]] to a Real Being in a Real Encounter
	* Not : imaginary (example: future generations)


# Process of CARE ABOUT:
![[care for vs care about.png]]
* Example:
	* An American professor sends charity money to starving children in Somalia.


# Challenge 1 :
* philosophy and politics talk a lot of Care About
* Care For is seen as "domestic", belonging to private life only
* but Care About comes from Care For
* Care Theory argues that what's personal is political
* without Care For, Care About is just "virtue talk"
* systematically (politically and philosophically), 
	* we need to create conditions so people can naturally Care For without sacrificing themselves

---> need to promote the insight in language difference of Care For and Care About

# Challenge 2 :
![[rehab care.png]]
care is mistaken with self-sacrifices and joyless obligations
---> need a language for the joy of care

# Challenge 3 :
![[intrinsic loop of care.png]]
* this is a mutual joy and fulfillment.
* but currently, we call those who are cared-for "needy"
	-> don't encourage receiving care
	-> prioritize freedom, individualism, independence
	-> devalue care, interdependence, interconnection

---> need a new language for those who are cared-for
