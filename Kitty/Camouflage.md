[[INTIMACY]] is NOT:
+ Knowing how to make others feel seen/comfortable
+ Understanding (the RULES of) social interactions
+ Being aware of impression made on others
because all of the above can be
* camouflaging

intimacy may be...

1. connection that *feels* relaxing
	* does NOT exhaust you 
	* exhaustion = masking

2. two-way connection
	* mutual
	* not: 1 visible:1 invisible
	* two-way unmasking

3. safety
	* regulating ≠ triggering
	* respectful ≠ polite
	* feel happy ≠ smiling
	* room for diversity: 
		* unconditional acceptance?

questions:
* what is the place of "small talks" in intimacy?
	* i cannot do small talks because i freeze...
		* don't know what to say back fast enough
		* don't see the purpose/meaning
		* not interested in social rituals
		* unstructured when lack depth + time 
		* not interested in trends, celebrities, etc.
	* but small talks make some people feel safe (by being polite & testing the water cautiously)
