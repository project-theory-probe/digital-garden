#### Sub: Amazing leads for [[THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY]]!


![[intimacy_haunt_social.jpg]]

### Some key terms I am tracing:

- **Entanglement**
    - intra-act, beyond all possibilities of disengagement
- **Haunt**
    - presence—felt, but not seen
- **Transgenerational haunt** (Nicholas Abraham & Mariah Torok)
    - phantom (unresolved traumas, secrets, unspoken griefs) transmit across generations
    - pass down blindspots + mesmerize our multiple egos without knowledge of
- **Performativity**
    - the haunt is performed, re-enacted, producing reality

→ Blindspots and systemic censorships create unconscious desires which have material effects.


### Questions, in terms of social theory:

→ Which material effects are observable in social systems?

→ What happens to the psyche / social systems when you make the ghosts visible?

→ What infrastructures or architecture reveal ghosts?

- techno-ontological implications of Deleuze’s machinic assemblage
    > A machinic assemblage connects and convolutes the disparate in terms of potential fields and virtual elements and crosses techno-ontological thresholds without fidelity to relationships of genus or species.

    - Variation doesn’t come only from random mutations but evolve through “long-lasting intimacy of strangers”
