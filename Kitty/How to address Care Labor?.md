- Care Labor is all the work that sustains the system's well-being:
	* Example 1: A colleague’s kindness in a meeting is Care Labor that maintains an enjoyable environment for the team's productivity.
	* Example 2: A maid who cleans the house to make it an enjoyable space for those who live in it.
	
	- Projecation is only possible when there is A LOT of Care Labor.
	- Without Care Labor, capitalism collapses into hostility, depression, and unlivability. Capitalism NEEDS care labor so that workers continue to work while maintaining a bare-minimum happiness.

### **Capitalism’s Strategy: 

- Care Labor is systematically **devalued** to maximize surplus.
- To keep profits high, workers must be made to have...
	- fewer and cheaper needs and desires
	- low pay = deemed as "less worthy"
#### **Strategies to Devalue Care**:

1. **Declaring it "free" or "natural"**
    
    - **"Unskilled labor"**: Framed as easy, requiring no real effort.
    - **“Natural”**: Framed as requiring no training. Expected from certain groups (e.g., women, caregivers); refusal is demonized.
    - Making it **non-visible**, invisible.
    
2. **Systematizing unpaid Care Labor**
    
    - **Criminalizing non-wage life** (e.g., "subsistence lifestyles", "informal economies", "surplus population").
    - **Relying on the family** as the site for unpaid care labor.
	    - **Stigmatizing “deviant” ways of living** outside nuclear family and wage labor.
    - **Treating care workers as disposable, temporary resources.**
    - **Reducing alternative incomes** to force dependence on capitalism.
    - **Enforcing a workforce** that:
        1. Affectively invests in work (aka being able to be happy = not depressed while working).
        2. Preserves the current organization of society (aka status quo).
        3. Obedient or "disciplined" (eg. glorify being on-time and following deadlines and expectations)...
    * **Relying on families and "mothering" to translate capitalist values into the child**:
	    * Example: Middle & upper-class children learn to identify their feelings and manage them well, making them more desirable as workers.

> “We are exploited when we are compelled to work for others, either by force or because we have to work to meet our own needs, but we receive less back than what we put into that work.” (Gotby, 37)


Quests:

* To create the feeling of projecation, care labor needs to be understood and systemically addressed.
	* How? Do we pay or engage in a different economy? 
	* If we engage in a different, non-transactional economy, like "gift economy", would that prevent participation from people who NEED capital to survive (example: poor, unhealthy, disabled, stigmatized individuals)?
* Does everyone involve in projecation required to have a "good management of wellbeing" (aka good practice of care)? 
	* Will they most likely be from middle to upper class?
* Addressing Care is to enter the realm of Morality, which makes the topic triggering to those who benefit from the status quo:
	* What are the possible paths to include this in popular conversations without creating divisions? 
	* Is "disrupt" the crucial path forward? 

* How do we both redistribute capital AND reimagine an involutionary system that rewards care?
