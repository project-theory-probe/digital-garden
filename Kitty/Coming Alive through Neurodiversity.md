Erin Manning and Brian Massumi in [*Coming Alive in a World of Texture: For Neurodiversity*](https://academic.oup.com/minnesota-scholarship-online/book/21219/chapter-abstract/180866777?redirectedFrom=fulltext):
* link [[autism]] with "an engagement with the more-than-human"
	* "to experience the texture of the world without discrimination" (pp. 74) 
	* to experience life before language (pre-articulate expressibility), "prior to the distinction between active and passive, subject and object" (pp. 80)
	* "attentiveness of the environment to its own flowering" (pp. 77)
	* everything becomes alive
		* "becoming alive with co-composition"
		* "an un-hierarchized commitment to ... a textured world, alive with difference"
* introduce the vocabulary...
	* environmental awareness AND subtractive awareness
		* pattern > chunking and subtracting

in short, linking autism with...
* [[aliveness]]
* [[In-Visibility]] (perception)
* [[insight]] (mode)
* [[relational ontology]]
* [[diffraction]]
