Staying with the Trouble by Donna Haraway is a mark of love.
--> Making the Trouble, I see, is also a mark of love.

What do we do when we witness someone causing a trouble?
* A fear for the breakdown of a system?
* Exercise control?
* Care for why they did what they did?
* Involve in the revolution?

Some quest to expand worlds, some quest to achieve goals. Both are important.

When a living being is suffocated, do we quest to make the world more breathable for them? Or do we quest to find methods of collaboration?

My observation is, everywhere I go, I seem to create "troubles", directly or indirectly.

Random examples for illustration:

* Protest at the biggest international meditation center (Plum Village, France, 2024) (directly)
	* Trouble: for the status quo
	* Chance: a call for spiritual centers truly listen to world's traumas (genocide in Gaza) instead of "staying neutral" to be "politically safe/correct"

* Friends breaking up (indirectly)
	* Trouble: for the status quo
	* Chance: ending a toxic relationship

* Walk away from Publisher's camp
	* Trouble: for the status quo
	* Chance: preserving the humanistic right to claim autonomy and creative safety

Troubles test the bandwidth of care of a culture.
After a trouble is conducted, I find that staying & humble curiosity (or ontological questing) are the 2 best steps forward. Because they then create a new and kinder world.
