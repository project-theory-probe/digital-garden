From the language built by Christopher Alexander,
and guiding feelings I feel from PTP team:

- Lebendigkeit
	- The quality of liveliness in everything: a stone, a cloud, a poem, a cat, a building, a human, etc.
	- We are pursuing a quest to understand, thus, protect …
		- Livingness: joy, aliveness, living creativity / system...
		- What it means to be a free person
			- Ability to adapt with situations is freedom
			- Creative power in the service of life
	- In intimacy (human relations), called: the feeling of "home", "oneness".
		- I feel at home with Shotaro and Haruma.
		- I met Shotaro at a Danish Museum called Far Away from Home.


> “[...] design as the art of creating living order in systems, the desire to give a building as much life as possible.” (Helmut Leitner explaining [[Christopher Alexander]])

- Naturally, you/we advocate for the authentic artist.   
- Technically, you/we are building a language (vocabulary) → pattern → environment to create a living order in all systems.

Sharing from myself:

- Nature: 
	- I easily get in-tuned with life forces due to my biological sensitivity (: “psychic ability”, Alexander: "livingness").
- Environment does not condone my Nature:
	- My environment is not conducive to my wellbeing. 
	- Zombie as default mode of living.
- Tools I develop to maintain my Nature:
	- Creation of [[Từ Từ]] is to spark and preserve aliveness (: empathy, joy, gentleness) in daily human connections.
