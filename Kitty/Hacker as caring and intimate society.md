* happily, I found more language for the [[Architecture of Intimacy]] by reading [The Hacker Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_the_Information_Age) and some random hacker writings:
	* it allows me to explain my personal ethics

for example: 
* important ethics to protect (106, Chapter The Nethic):
	* Freedom of expression
		* enables: publicly active member of society
	* Privacy
		* enables: personal lifestyle without manipulation from authorities or powers
	* Personal activity
		* enables: self-actualization instead of passive receiver

* some methods:
	* developing is researching is learning
		* these are not separate activities (a world where a student is not a researcher and is not a practitioner!)
	* sharing and peers participation right from the start
		* bazaar, not selected members (which leads to exclusivity and elitism)
	* copy-left
		* open-source (not gate-keep to monetize and overpower)
	* task-oriented
		* focus on the *passion* *and* process *and* outcome (not time-oriented)
	* etc.

* they align with my views, as i see these practices as apparatus that is...	
	* enabling: engagement <-> active criticality <-> agency <-> whole person <-> care <-> intimacy
	* an autistic paradise

* is this a diffractive model of society?
