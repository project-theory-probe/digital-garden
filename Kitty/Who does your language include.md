* I read this [interview of bell hooks](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/1994/07/01/bell-hooks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&curius=4403)

* Snoopy Doggy Dog:
	* “I don’t rap. I just talk. I want to be able to relax and conversate with my people.” 

* bell hooks:
	* “conversate and cross” borders 
	* if don't conversate, then we just talk to those with class privilege
	* to "cross boundaries", you have to share personal details and stories

"  Crossing borders means that at times I share things that I don’t want to share. But if you really see yourself as a worker for freedom, then the challenge is also on you to sacrifice whatever notions of privacy that many of us would want to hold onto, especially if we are clinging to bourgeois models of self and identity.
