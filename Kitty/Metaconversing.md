I find many commonalities between decolonial activism and empathy-based conversations. The 2 fields, decolonial studies (for example, Critical Race Theory, which talks about society as a whole) and the private sphere of conversations can learn from each other.

Randome notes:

On pain:
	* When you don't mention the person's pain but stay neutral, you betray the victim from having space to acknowledge their pain.
	* It's more about the relationship than the actual story.

On shame:
	* Maslow's Hierarchy: There is no self-actualization without eradicating shame.
	* How shame and guilt are engineered into the human interaction.
