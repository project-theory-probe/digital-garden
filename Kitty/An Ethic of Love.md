a term introduced by [bell hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks) in [Love As The Practice Of Freedom](https://blackcommunityhamburg.blackblogs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/920/2020/10/bell-hooks-Love-as-the-Practice-of-Freedom.pdf):
an ethic of love is
* opposite from the ethic of domination
* what happens when this becomes our foundation?
	* can this be foundation for X?
* currently, there is no powerful discourse on love emerging from politics, theories, or social movements

history:
* we have a history of political domination and violence
* the legacy of unreconciled griefs
* a culture that negates human value requires violence to sustain itself = anti-love

 current revolutions:
* rising trend: 
	* self-interest to end what's hurting us
	* focus on hardness & toughness
* *not* *yet*: 
	* collective transformation of society
	* end to politics of domination
		* ex. feminist movement that embraced white supremacy & racism
		* ex. black power movement that embraced sexism
	* Martin Luther King declared, "I have decided to love."
		* but no continuation of King's politics from an ethic of love ever since

--> we need an ethic of love to intervene in our self-centered longing for change
--> political decolonization
--> ontological transformation

calling for...
* developing a language of X (care/love/web/?) instead of violence
* decolonization:
	* a revival of *web* as ontology
* Joanna Macy in World As Lover, World As Self, wrote: 
	* "the refusal to *feel* take a heavy toll"
	* a revival of *feelings* as primacy to existence
* a progressive political theory and practice on love
	* how to stop seeing love as "sentimental" and "irrelevant"?
	* a politics and judicial system of [[Practice of care]] that's valued like our system of Justice/Fairness
