Haruma wrote, we have been digging tunnels from different sides of the mountain, yet here we are, finding one another in the middle point. In our PTP home, my life is a wide difference in terms of mother tongue, culture, generation, profession and so forth. Yet I know we share a lingo and walk towards the same direction. If we are different reincarnations of the same being according to Andy Weir’s egg theory, then at least momentarily in this phase of our life, we are recognizing ourselves in each other and "colluding" to probe forward.

At the time that I began creating zines for PTP, I also started reading [[David Graeber]]. His determination that 

> revolutionary actions must reconstitute our social relations in ways that are different from the domination in which we oppose

– lends me the language to grasp one important dimension that bridges our tunnels together: The kinds of project and revolutionary change that PTP probes into, the quality of our intimate life is an important measure of it.

This month’s zine is created from a corner of Kathmandu, Nepal. It was the week that I stayed at an anarchist art residence called Kaalo 101. It was also the week where horrible rains hit the city and took away more than 160 lives – the heaviest monsoon rains in 2 decades. The contrasting dance of togetherness and struggles play its melody within and without myself. It provides the emotional necessity that pushes anyone who walks on any self-actualizing path a serious commitment to optimism. Such a contrast appears in all conversations about love and intimacy.
