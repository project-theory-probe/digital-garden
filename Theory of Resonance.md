* Building onto my own discussion [["Difference" in Barad and Luhmann + a missing link]]
* Modal Construction is placed in between
	* Ontological Emergence (Barad): How difference comes into being
	* Systemic Recursion (Luhmann):How distinctions become codes and programs
* It is about Stabilizing Pattern: How enacted differences sediment into norms
* Hopefully we can:
	* Trace how material-discursive events crystallize into institutional forms.
	* Diagnose where ethics (Barad) becomes programming (Luhmann)—and vice versa.
	* Offer a way to track how difference stabilizes without becoming rigid.
* We may be able to investigate with the metaphor of "resonance" in mind
	* It is cohesive with Barad's view of understanding everything as "wave"
	* Resonance is one of the most powerful physical and metaphorical models we have—because it explains both amplification and selectivity through relational fit.	
* People to follow:
	* Hartmut Rosa on Resonance
	* Michel Serreson Interference
	* Joseph Rouse on Normativity
