- Recently, I see in my "autistic view" ...
	- There are similar patterns, I wrote repeatedly
		- Issue 14 Editor's Note - Balance of (any type of) power
		- Issue 15 Editor's Note - "Me" as a code runner / code from others make "me"
		- Issue 16 Editor's Note - Red Panda's personal space as be read by others
		- Issue 17 Editor's Note - Inner border of "self"
		- [[The Strategy of Capitalism Economy Port]] - [[UNIBA]] is reaching to dual system of capitalism and "X"
		- [[柄谷行人|Kojin Karatani]] - Four interchange format that exist at same time
		- All of Issue 17 - This issue is multi-directional ... so it's hard to write conclusion but fun. why?
		- ...
	- The pattern looks like complex interactions of gravity
		- or a multi dimension scene
- I may be trying ...
	- Beyond adopting / choosing "one"
		- Me or Them
		- Good or Evil
		- Love or Hate
		- Create or Sell
		- Capitalism or X (like a new communism)
		- ...
	- All can and should exist simultaneously
		- Systems also interact with each other
			- ... runs others in itself
	- However
		- Dominant system is also exist in each
		- And changes its balance
			- I think this is fun, conflict, suffering
			- History itself
