	- this is my theme itself
		- that surprised me
		- it's a chance to clarify (with shotaro)
- probing programmers society is not only my personal interest
	- that is today's problems 
		- Software is more influential than ever and it is important to know about it 
		- Software is misunderstood (it is under the influence of paper and document culture and its function is hidden behind the decoration, as in the covered wagon effect) 
		- Faced with the pessimistic side of technology Hackers themselves are unable to develop a new vision
			- It is becoming a problem that is more deeply rooted in people than in technology itself
