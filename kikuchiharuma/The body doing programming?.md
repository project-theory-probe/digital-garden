- 数学する身体 (2015)
	- Morita Masao 
	- (The Body Doing Mathematics)
- He wrote...
	- mathematics
		- which had been constructed through natural language and physical manipulation
		- has developed, and computation itself can now be objectified through mathematics
		- theoretical ”Turing Machine” were implemented
			- and became computers today
	- mathematics reach extreme abstraction in 20th century
		- that enables liberate computation from the body
	- but
		- mathematics cant explain what "1" is
			- its still in the body and history
	- Kiyoshi Oka and Alan Turing tried 
		- going beyond computation to explore what mathematics is all about
- im thinking about...
	- similarity with programming and math
		- math enables mathematician to live in its construction
			- it will be similar to hackers
			- hackers live in programming
				- and that make their thoughts, actions and body
	- application to natural language
		- language about the language that makes the project possible
	- limits shared by computation and software
		- that suggests need for integrity
