- these articles are thinking about a new (aspect of) way of being
	- (not denying other aspects: capital, social authority, etc. ... not karatani's X)
- These articles may be trying to make doing something the basis of existence

- that is ...
	- When something is doing, it can exist
		- (The middle voice probably expresses this better)
	- If so...
		- It tends to move away from the distinction between self and other
		- It envision a reciprocal world
			- (It is not necessary to think of some transaction or purpose as a precondition for an action)
- How can we communicate about this ontology?
	- How to grow it without hurting something?

		- The new ontology is does not distinguish between good and bad
		- Therefore, it is neither an enemy nor a friend of anything
