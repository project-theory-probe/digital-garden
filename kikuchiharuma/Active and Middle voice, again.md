- I mentioned [[中動態の世界 意志と責任の考古学]] in [[We project well.]]
	- Kokubun proposes a verb history (he speculates) in this book
		- there were two type of verbs about 2000 years ago
			- active ... starts with the subject and ends outside
			- middle ... starts with the subject and include itself
			- there was no category to treat person or people as an owner or cause
		- there was only one type of verb in past of past (more than 2000 years)
			- middle like verb ... no distinction for where it happened
				- also by whom
		- the verb didn't even exist in very origin
			- nouns ... noun-like verbs as generalizations of actions
		- and today, there is strong tendency to separate active and passive (and lost middle type)
			- it involves the "will" to do everything
			- it could be a distinction ancient languages have not
	- Is ptp trying to revive such a existence, project?
		- and cure tendency to  identify who owns everything
		- this seems to be related to [[My Expect for Projecation]]
