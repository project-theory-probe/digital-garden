- N. Katherine Hayles
	- 10 - 15 years ago
		- I read some of her books
			- Not logically
			- Just feel comfortable
				- not just comfort
				- it seems be my adventure
					- optimistic about software and network
					- but today, it's too optimistic
		- I borrowed from her
			- "Embodied Virtuality"
			- as UNIBA's tag line
	- Last week
		- I found her name in an article about "Post Humanism"
			- with
				- Karen Barad
				- Humberto Maturana
				- Francisco Varela
				- etc.
		- I was just finding new name for "a relativized view of humanity"
- Hayles ...
	- explains very well the difference with "paper world"
		- and its possibility (in radical way)
	-  especially
		- the transformation of people at that time
			- this is the most important point
				- for the hacker culture
- Perhaps we need to say "human" in the middle voice
	- but 
		- Non -
		- More Than -
		- Post - 
		- or counter (ex. material)
	- these names are not enough
- if we could place "technology"
	- in the middle (between human and nature, etc.) of the world
		- with affecting both people and nature,
		- it archives an effect of middle voice, partially
	- but someone put "technology" into tools, under (or out of) human
		- we learn quasi-language for that,
		- and sometimes achieve ideal cooperation
			- beyond many divides
			- it has happened occasionally through the world history
- her suggestions help us to see 
	- the many worlds opened by quasi-languages
