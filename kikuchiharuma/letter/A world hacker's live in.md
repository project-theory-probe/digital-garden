- Dialogue with [[shotaroyagi|shotaro]]
	- I told about a history of Arts and Science
		- the process of dividing the Religion to Art and Science
			- Art is a myth about independence of 
				- human-like or human-derived
			- Science is a myth about independence of 
				- nature-like or nature-dirived
		- I can't be sure
			- about this story
	- but an interesting point of this story is ...
		- Suggestion about the dangers of 
			- dividing the world into humanity and nature itself
		- I want to say about
			- what does the calculation machines 
				- Alan Turing enabled the model of general computing
					- It spread to today's world as personal system
					- And it also understand human-read/writable language today
						- human-readable code exchange to formula (computing) behind
		- It become to have qualities of both Art and Science
			- It can calculate not human-acceptable answers
				- It never happen on "art subsystem" as accept-game
			- It can not calculate contrary to the nature
				- It never happen on "science subsystem" as truth-game
	- My point is...
		- Hackers may be the first people to try to adapt to this new realm
			- the blurred area of distinction between humans and the nature
				- A certain "humanity" is not exist there
					- be superior to nature
					- interpret the world
						- especially by natural language
		- In some ways, they are like animals
			- However, they have programming languages
				- it relies on both human and nature ... even cannot tell apart them
			- Natural language can do something acceptable to (only) human if it is not so to nature
				- Hackers (and their language) can't do that
					- This may be the origin why they are humble
			- Formulae can never express the complexity of the human mind
				- This may be the origin why they are careless with social matter
		- as the origin of their ontology
			- It would be interesting in a way as the birth of language
