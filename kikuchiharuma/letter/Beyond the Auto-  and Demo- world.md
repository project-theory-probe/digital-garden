- so many people mention at "wordless" problem
	- [[柄谷行人|Karatani]]'s X
	- [[Christopher Alexander|Alexander]]'s Nameless Quality
	- etc.
- Those are all "more than selves".
	- union with oneself
	- selflessness
	- ... etc.
- It looks like "more than human" movements
	- more than - human
	- post - human
	- non - human
	- not - human ... material, god, infinity
	- relativized human ... multi species
		- I think nameless approach is one of these struggles
			- to abandon naming human
			- but this is a just escape from the original problem
- We have not the word for this,
	- or we can say this our language limits us, instead
		- from small to large scale
			- (personal level to human specie level)
			- a person / human being is just existing
				- also it is with the world
- if we have another language ...
	- middle voices will solve this
		- human-ing
		- me-ing
		- etc.
			- like friending
- emerging auto-crats (self - centric - belief) are ...
	- monsters of "selves"
	- demo-cracy (everyone - centric -belief) is not enough as counter for it
		- this is a limitation of self or every division
			- I think
		- so what our ahead is a
			- not self-ish
			- not everyone-ish
				- thing
		- it may be ...
			- simulation world
				- like
					- music
					- software
					- game
						- etc.
			- it shaped by
				- quasi-whole (complex enough)
				- quasi-self (partially me)
			- it is in between
				- world of natural - language
				- world of body (internal organ)
					- may be
				- autistic view can approach to body or environment
		- [[Quasi-Language]] may support opening this level
			- partially realized in 
				- score - music
				- programming language - software
					- manners
			- also
				- [[Alistair Cockburn]] says
					- we can work together like we play a game
				- that's the level of this
					- game needs
						- world building rules and attitudes
							- seriousness
								- without risking someone's life
				- I think this is "the theory of projects"
					- this encourage and embrace people
					- and get over the limitation of struggle with 
						- the nature of the brain, 
						- the body, 
						- others
						- other species
						- and matter
