	- [[shotaroyagi|shotaro]]
		- The true nature of language
			- we are forced to belong that when using language
		- that even affects being of ourselves
			- causes many kinds of mis-understanding or mis-communications
		- it seems to enable explain the history of software community
			- their effort to explain themselves to others (especially business people)
			- some way of existing are destined to failure of dialogue
				- also empathy, respect ... more

		- The realm between us to be found
			- it is difficult to see, call, discuss ... share
		- and the reason
			- a lack of vocabulary
			- we need more words to understanding us
- my hope
	- mis-communications will be overcame by new vocabularies
