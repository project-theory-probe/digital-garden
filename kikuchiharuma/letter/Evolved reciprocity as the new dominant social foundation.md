	- describe history by methods of exchange
		- the dominant method makes social structure
		- or explain social evolution by the change of dominant method
	- he lists four major methods
		- reciprocity (gifts and returns)
		- takeover and redistribution (control and protection)
		- commercial (money and buying and selling)
		- X (evolved reciprocity)
	- these methods are existing simultaneously in each society
		- just dominant
		- not exclusive
- for us ...
	- X seems to be the realization of the state we are looking for
		- feeling in [[Projecation]]
		- truly intimate space
		- the space hackers love
		- ... etc.
- can we think of our effort in this point ...
	- conflicts between exchange methods
		- hackers struggles: commercial - X
			- cooperation that transcends the logic of capital
		- in/visible voices: control and protection - X
			- social division
			- situations where contradictions are imposed on specific people
				- ex. women
				- ex. north-south problem
- quest:
	- what an evolved world of reciprocity looks like?
		- [[柄谷行人|Kojin Karatani]]'s description attempts to portray the inherent potential of Marx's considerations
			- it is an attempt to meet the demands of the 70's when he was young
			- we need to think a little differently
	- especially,
		- what then does the logic of capital and its logic of controlling others look like?
			- when evolved reciprocity realized
	- could this perspective unify our efforts into one?
		- it could include multiple problems in todays society.
		- but it may share a new world
