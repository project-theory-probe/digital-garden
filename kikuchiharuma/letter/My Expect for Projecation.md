- Projecation
	- when i met this word through hearing from [[shotaroyagi|shotaro]]
		- very interested in its doubled structure
			- doubled meaning?
		- the first is
			- project - vacation
				- projects what like a vacation
				- as its natural origin
		- the second is
			- pro- ject - ation
				- projecting itself
				- things what being a project
	- today's project
		- is mis-understood
			- that is too business like
			- too goal oriented
				- make people means to an end
				- that itself can be painful
	- the nature of project
		- or its origin is ...
			- exists like a vacation
				- what should be cured
				- what is lost in today's world
			- organizes structure of itself
				- what should be taken back
				- too forced by others in today
			- accept what happens
				- the way of share with others in deeper sense
				- the joy of living
	- its similar to self-organized teams
		- [[What question does the article answer?]]
			- It changes its own process.
			- It exists like a game.
			- Have clear rules about self and accept what happens.
			- Confronting (human made) nature
- it seems fulfill what I want to do in two ways, in same time
	- cure today's lack of sense
		- remind us its nature
	- define the original form of project (team, or creativity of people)
		- what do we need to do pro - ject
- this is my thought when writing [[Issue 10 Editor's Note]]
