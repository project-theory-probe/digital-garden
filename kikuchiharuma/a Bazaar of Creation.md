- i'm writing the new [[UNIBA]] manifesto
	- in accordance with
		- [[The Strategy of Capitalism Economy Port]]
- i've discussed with [[UNIBA]] people
	- in draft 1
		- we felt discomfort with the key phrase
			- 無償の交換
				- "free interchange" in english?
			- it is ...
				- too objective description
				- tasteless
				- not expressing personal experience
				- recalling the "subject" / old "me"
	- i write draft 2
		- i pick a new phrase
			- "Bazaar of Creation"
				- 創造のバザール
			- this probably means a space for projecation or intimacy etc. for us
			- we also need a physical space like Alexander's.
				- we first make it in people's interactions
