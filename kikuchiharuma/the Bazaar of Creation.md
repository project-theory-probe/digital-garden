I agree with many things [[Kitty]] wrote in [[Why need a (participatory) pattern language of intimacy.]]

>To be intimate—_truly seeing and understanding in the way that organically brings forth a caring response-ability_—is a way of being, an ontology!

How invite new people to this?

For me, [[UNIBA]] is a place for trying that,
The lesson is...

- Very few people (in [[UNIBA]]) can change their ontology by dialogue or theoretical thinking
	- Many people are struggling to adapt to UNIBA
		- Some people think this 'company' lacks initiative
			- lack of some kind of 'response'
- Tools and behaviors were more effective
	- I think ... the reason of [[UNIBA]] people like 'making' is 
	- materials (or nature) respond to them naturally, 
	- so they love dialogue with materials, not social interaction.
- We can't physical world or laws
	- but software allowed us to create our own social environment
	- also Hackers do.

Now [[UNIBA]] is grabbing a new scape named 'Bazaar (of creation)'. It is ...

- Base of living
- Architecture of Metaphysics and Physics ... and Software
- Anyone can come in
- No purpose, just a place of us

My plan is...

- Gathering many UNIBA-Likes
- Developing tools that support behaviors
	- Tools as infrastructure of the Bazaar 
- Help people there
