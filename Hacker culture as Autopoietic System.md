* From the previous conversation with [[kikuchiharuma]]
	* Hacker culture has it's own media
		* Turing Machine = Calculation and Accurate Reproducibility 
	* GIT
		* Shared (complicated) possible world 
		* Chosen by it's usefulness (pragmatic/ multivocal = evolution of species)
	* Drive
		* Playfulness
		* Openness to join and participants can choose themselves how they want to contribute
* Luhmann's Functional Subsystem
	* He doesn't quite say what is required to become a "functional subsystem." The reason is because he didn't aim to provide whole pictures of each subsystem. Rather they are demonstrations of his overall theory.
	* Here are some elements:
		* 2 Value Code
		* Media
		* Relationship with other Functional Subsystem
		* Self-reference
			* As element
			* As process
			* As system

* Why is Hacker Culture distinct from other subsystem?
	* Not like economy
	* Not like art
	* Not like law

* Erick Raymond/ The Halloween Documents on related points
	* Economic incentives and/or legal binding won't enable Linux
* Abstract
	* Programmer has their unique communication distinct from any other functional subsystem Luhmann has proposed.
	* In fact, looking into the open software projects like Linux, we get to understand that they operates in a unique communication style with media.
	* Here we propose that hacker culture is a distinct functional subsystem which has a Turing Machine as its unique features of reproducibility. Through the invention of Git, the technology has become a media that allows programmers to communicate materialistically.
